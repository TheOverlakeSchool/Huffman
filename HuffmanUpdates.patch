+  Ber. He.
+  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
+  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
+  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,

+  Ber. Say-
+    What, is Horatio there ?
+  Hor. A piece of him.
+  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
+  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
+  Ber. I have seen nothing.
+  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
+    And will not let belief take hold of him
+    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
+    Therefore I have entreated him along,  
+    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
+    That, if again this apparition come,
+    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
+  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
+  Ber. Sit down awhile,
+    And let us once again assail your ears,
+    That are so fortified against our story,
+    What we two nights have seen.
+  Hor. Well, sit we down,
+    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
+  Ber. Last night of all,
+    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
+    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
+    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
+    The bell then beating one-
+
+                        Enter Ghost.
+
+  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
+  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  
+  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
+  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
+  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
+  Ber. It would be spoke to.
+  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
+  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
+    Together with that fair and warlike form
+    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
+    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
+  Mar. It is offended.
+  Ber. See, it stalks away!
+  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
+                                                     Exit Ghost.
+  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
+  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
+    Is not this something more than fantasy?
+    What think you on't?
+  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
+    Without the sensible and true avouch
+    Of mine own eyes.  
+  Mar. Is it not like the King?
+  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
+    Such was the very armour he had on
+    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
+    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
+    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
+    'Tis strange.
+  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
+    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
+  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
+    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
+    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
+  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
+    Why this same strict and most observant watch
+    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
+    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
+    And foreign mart for implements of war;
+    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
+    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
+    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
+    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
+    Who is't that can inform me?
+  Hor. That can I.
+    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
+    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
+    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
+    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
+    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
+    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
+    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
+    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
+    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
+    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
+    Against the which a moiety competent
+    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
+    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
+    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
+    And carriage of the article design'd,
+    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
+    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,  
+    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
+    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
+    For food and diet, to some enterprise
+    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
+    As it doth well appear unto our state,
+    But to recover of us, by strong hand
+    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
+    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
+    Is the main motive of our preparations,
+    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
+    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
+  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
+    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
+    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
+    That was and is the question of these wars.
+  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
+    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
+    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
+    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
+    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;  
+    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
+    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
+    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
+    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
+    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
+    As harbingers preceding still the fates
+    And prologue to the omen coming on,
+    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
+    Unto our climature and countrymen.
+
+                      Enter Ghost again.
+
+    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
+    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
+                                               Spreads his arms.
+    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
+    Speak to me.
+    If there be any good thing to be done,
+    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
+    Speak to me.  
+    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
+    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
+    O, speak!
+    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
+    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
+    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
+                                                 The cock crows.
+    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
+  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
+  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
+  Ber. 'Tis here!
+  Hor. 'Tis here!
+  Mar. 'Tis gone!
+                                                     Exit Ghost.
+    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
+    To offer it the show of violence;
+    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
+    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
+  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
+  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  
+    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
+    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
+    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
+    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
+    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
+    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
+    To his confine; and of the truth herein
+    This present object made probation.
+  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
+    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
+    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
+    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
+    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
+    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
+    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
+    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
+  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
+    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
+    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
+    Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
+    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
+    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
+    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
+    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
+    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
+    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
+    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.
+
+
+
+
+Scene II.
+Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.
+
+Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet,
+Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
+Lords Attendant.
+
+  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
+    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
+    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
+    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
+    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
+    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
+    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
+    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
+    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
+    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
+    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
+    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
+    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
+    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
+    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
+    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
+    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
+    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
+    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
+    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
+    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
+    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
+    Importing the surrender of those lands
+    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
+    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
+    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
+    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
+    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
+    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
+    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
+    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
+    The lists, and full proportions are all made
+    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
+    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
+    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
+    Giving to you no further personal power
+    To business with the King, more than the scope
+    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
+    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
+  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
+  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
+                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
+    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
+    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
+    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
+    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
+    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
+    The head is not more native to the heart,
+    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
+    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
+    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
+  Laer. My dread lord,
+    Your leave and favour to return to France;
+    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
+    To show my duty in your coronation,  
+    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
+    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
+    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
+  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
+  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
+    By laboursome petition, and at last
+    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
+    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
+  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
+    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
+    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
+  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
+  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
+  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
+  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
+    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
+    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
+    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
+    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
+    Passing through nature to eternity.  
+  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
+  Queen. If it be,
+    Why seems it so particular with thee?
+  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
+    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
+    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
+    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
+    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
+    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
+    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
+    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
+    For they are actions that a man might play;
+    But I have that within which passeth show-
+    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
+  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
+    To give these mourning duties to your father;
+    But you must know, your father lost a father;
+    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
+    In filial obligation for some term
+    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever  
+    In obstinate condolement is a course
+    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
+    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
+    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
+    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
+    For what we know must be, and is as common
+    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
+    Why should we in our peevish opposition
+    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
+    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
+    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
+    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
+    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
+    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
+    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
+    As of a father; for let the world take note
+    You are the most immediate to our throne,
+    And with no less nobility of love
+    Than that which dearest father bears his son
+    Do I impart toward you. For your intent  
+    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
+    It is most retrograde to our desire;
+    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
+    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
+    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
+  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
+    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
+  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
+  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
+    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
+    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
+    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
+    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
+    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
+    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
+    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
+                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
+  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
+    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
+    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  
+    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
+    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
+    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
+    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
+    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
+    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
+    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
+    So excellent a king, that was to this
+    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
+    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
+    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
+    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
+    As if increase of appetite had grown
+    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
+    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
+    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
+    With which she followed my poor father's body
+    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
+    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
+    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;  
+    My father's brother, but no more like my father
+    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
+    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
+    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
+    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
+    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
+    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
+    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
+
+          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.
+
+  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
+  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
+    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
+  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
+  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
+    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
+    Marcellus?
+  Mar. My good lord!
+  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-  
+    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
+  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
+  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
+    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
+    To make it truster of your own report
+    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
+    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
+    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
+  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
+  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
+    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
+  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
+  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
+    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
+    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
+    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
+    My father- methinks I see my father.
+  Hor. O, where, my lord?
+  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
+  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.  
+  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
+    I shall not look upon his like again.
+  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
+  Ham. Saw? who?
+  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
+  Ham. The King my father?
+  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
+    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
+    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
+    This marvel to you.
+  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
+  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
+    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
+    In the dead vast and middle of the night
+    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
+    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
+    Appears before them and with solemn march
+    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
+    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
+    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd  
+    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
+    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
+    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
+    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
+    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
+    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
+    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
+    These hands are not more like.
+  Ham. But where was this?
+  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
+  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
+  Hor. My lord, I did;
+    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
+    It lifted up it head and did address
+    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
+    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
+    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
+    And vanish'd from our sight.
+  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
+  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  
+    And we did think it writ down in our duty
+    To let you know of it.
+  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
+    Hold you the watch to-night?
+  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
+  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
+  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
+  Ham. From top to toe?
+  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
+  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
+  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
+  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
+  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
+  Ham. Pale or red?
+  Hor. Nay, very pale.
+  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
+  Hor. Most constantly.
+  Ham. I would I had been there.
+  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
+  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  
+  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
+  Both. Longer, longer.
+  Hor. Not when I saw't.
+  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
+  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
+    A sable silver'd.
+  Ham. I will watch to-night.
+    Perchance 'twill walk again.
+  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
+  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
+    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
+    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
+    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
+    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
+    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
+    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
+    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
+    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
+    I'll visit you.
+  All. Our duty to your honour.  
+  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
+                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
+    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
+    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
+    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
+    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
+Exit.
+
+
+
+
+Scene III.
+Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.
+
+Enter Laertes and Ophelia.
+
+  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
+    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
+    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
+    But let me hear from you.
+  Oph. Do you doubt that?
+  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
+    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
+    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
+    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
+    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
+    No more.
+  Oph. No more but so?
+  Laer. Think it no more.
+    For nature crescent does not grow alone
+    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
+    The inward service of the mind and soul
+    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,  
+    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
+    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
+    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
+    For he himself is subject to his birth.
+    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
+    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
+    The safety and health of this whole state,
+    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
+    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
+    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
+    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
+    As he in his particular act and place
+    May give his saying deed; which is no further
+    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
+    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
+    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
+    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
+    To his unmast'red importunity.
+    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
+    And keep you in the rear of your affection,  
+    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
+    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
+    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
+    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
+    The canker galls the infants of the spring
+    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
+    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
+    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
+    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
+    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
+  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
+    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
+    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
+    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
+    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
+    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
+    And recks not his own rede.
+  Laer. O, fear me not!
+
+                       Enter Polonius.  
+
+    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
+    A double blessing is a double grace;
+    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
+  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
+    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
+    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
+    And these few precepts in thy memory
+    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
+    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
+    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
+    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
+    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
+    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
+    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
+    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
+    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
+    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
+    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
+    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
+    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
+    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
+    And they in France of the best rank and station
+    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
+    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
+    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
+    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
+    This above all- to thine own self be true,
+    And it must follow, as the night the day,
+    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
+    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
+  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
+  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
+  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
+    What I have said to you.
+  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
+    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
+  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
+  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
+  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.  
+  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
+    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
+    Given private time to you, and you yourself
+    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
+    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
+    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
+    You do not understand yourself so clearly
+    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
+    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
+  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
+    Of his affection to me.
+  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
+    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
+    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
+  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
+  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
+    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
+    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
+    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
+    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.  
+  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
+    In honourable fashion.
+  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
+  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
+    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
+  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
+    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
+    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
+    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
+    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
+    You must not take for fire. From this time
+    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
+    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
+    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
+    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
+    And with a larger tether may he walk
+    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
+    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
+    Not of that dye which their investments show,
+    But mere implorators of unholy suits,  
+    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
+    The better to beguile. This is for all:
+    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
+    Have you so slander any moment leisure
+    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
+    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
+  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
+                                                         Exeunt.

+
+
+Scene IV.
+Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.
+
+Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.
+
+  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
+  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
+  Ham. What hour now?
+  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
+  Mar. No, it is struck.
+  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
+    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
+                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
+    What does this mean, my lord?
+  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
+    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
+    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
+    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
+    The triumph of his pledge.
+  Hor. Is it a custom?
+  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
+    But to my mind, though I am native here  
+    And to the manner born, it is a custom
+    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
+    This heavy-headed revel east and west
+    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
+    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
+    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
+    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
+    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
+    So oft it chances in particular men
+    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
+    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
+    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
+    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
+    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
+    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
+    The form of plausive manners, that these men
+    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
+    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
+    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
+    As infinite as man may undergo-  
+    Shall in the general censure take corruption
+    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
+    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.
+
+                         Enter Ghost.
+
+  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
+  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
+    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
+    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
+    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
+    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
+    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
+    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
+    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
+    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
+    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
+    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
+    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
+    To cast thee up again. What may this mean  
+    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
+    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
+    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
+    So horridly to shake our disposition
+    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
+    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
+                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
+  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
+    As if it some impartment did desire
+    To you alone.
+  Mar. Look with what courteous action
+    It waves you to a more removed ground.
+    But do not go with it!
+  Hor. No, by no means!
+  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
+  Hor. Do not, my lord!
+  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
+    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
+    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
+    Being a thing immortal as itself?  
+    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
+  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
+    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
+    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
+    And there assume some other, horrible form
+    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
+    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
+    The very place puts toys of desperation,
+    Without more motive, into every brain
+    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
+    And hears it roar beneath.
+  Ham. It waves me still.
+    Go on. I'll follow thee.
+  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
+  Ham. Hold off your hands!
+  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
+  Ham. My fate cries out
+    And makes each petty artire in this body
+    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
+                                                [Ghost beckons.]  
+    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
+    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
+    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
+                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
+  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
+  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
+  Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?
+  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
+  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
+  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
+                                                         Exeunt.
+
+
+
+
+Scene V.
+Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.
+
+Enter Ghost and Hamlet.
+
+  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
+  Ghost. Mark me.
+  Ham. I will.
+  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
+    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
+    Must render up myself.
+  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
+  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
+    To what I shall unfold.
+  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
+  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
+  Ham. What?
+  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
+    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
+    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
+    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
+    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid  
+    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
+    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
+    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
+    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
+    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
+    And each particular hair to stand an end
+    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
+    But this eternal blazon must not be
+    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
+    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
+  Ham. O God!
+  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
+  Ham. Murther?
+  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
+    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
+  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
+    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
+    May sweep to my revenge.
+  Ghost. I find thee apt;
+    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  
+    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
+    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
+    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
+    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
+    Is by a forged process of my death
+    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
+    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
+    Now wears his crown.
+  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
+    My uncle?
+  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
+    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
+    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
+    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
+    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
+    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
+    From me, whose love was of that dignity
+    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
+    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
+    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  
+    To those of mine!
+    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
+    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
+    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
+    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
+    And prey on garbage.
+    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
+    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
+    My custom always of the afternoon,
+    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
+    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
+    And in the porches of my ears did pour
+    The leperous distilment; whose effect
+    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
+    That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
+    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
+    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
+    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
+    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
+    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,  
+    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
+    All my smooth body.
+    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
+    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
+    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
+    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
+    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
+    With all my imperfections on my head.
+  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
+  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
+    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
+    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
+    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
+    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
+    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
+    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
+    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
+    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
+    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
+    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.  
+  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
+    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
+    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
+    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
+    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
+    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
+    Yea, from the table of my memory
+    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
+    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
+    That youth and observation copied there,
+    And thy commandment all alone shall live
+    Within the book and volume of my brain,
+    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
+    O most pernicious woman!
+    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
+    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
+    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
+    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
+    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
+    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'  
+    I have sworn't.
+  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!
+
+                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
+
+  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
+  Hor. Heaven secure him!
+  Ham. So be it!
+  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
+  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
+  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
+  Hor. What news, my lord?
+  Mar. O, wonderful!
+  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
+  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
+  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
+  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
+  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
+    But you'll be secret?
+  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.  
+  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
+    But he's an arrant knave.
+  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
+    To tell us this.
+  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
+    And so, without more circumstance at all,
+    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
+    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
+    For every man hath business and desire,
+    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
+    Look you, I'll go pray.
+  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
+  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
+    Yes, faith, heartily.
+  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
+  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
+    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
+    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
+    For your desire to know what is between us,
+    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,  
+    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
+    Give me one poor request.
+  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
+  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
+  Both. My lord, we will not.
+  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
+  Hor. In faith,
+    My lord, not I.
+  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
+  Ham. Upon my sword.
+  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
+  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
+
+                 Ghost cries under the stage.
+
+  Ghost. Swear.
+  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
+    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
+    Consent to swear.
+  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.  
+  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
+    Swear by my sword.
+  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
+  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
+    Come hither, gentlemen,
+    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
+    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
+    Swear by my sword.
+  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
+  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
+    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
+  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
+  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
+    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
+    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
+    But come!
+    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
+    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
+    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
+    To put an antic disposition on),  
+    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
+    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
+    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
+    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
+    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
+    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
+    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
+    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
+    Swear.
+  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
+                                                   [They swear.]
+  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
+    With all my love I do commend me to you;
+    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
+    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
+    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
+    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
+    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
+    That ever I was born to set it right!
+    Nay, come, let's go together.  
+                                                         Exeunt.

+
+Act II. Scene I.
+Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.
+
+Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.
+
+  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
+  Rey. I will, my lord.
+  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
+    Before You visit him, to make inquire
+    Of his behaviour.
+  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
+  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
+    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
+    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
+    What company, at what expense; and finding
+    By this encompassment and drift of question
+    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
+    Than your particular demands will touch it.
+    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
+    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
+    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
+  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.  
+  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
+    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
+    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
+    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
+    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
+    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
+    As are companions noted and most known
+    To youth and liberty.
+  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
+  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
+    Drabbing. You may go so far.
+  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
+  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
+    You must not put another scandal on him,
+    That he is open to incontinency.
+    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
+    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
+    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
+    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
+    Of general assault.  
+  Rey. But, my good lord-
+  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
+  Rey. Ay, my lord,
+    I would know that.
+  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
+    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
+    You laying these slight sullies on my son
+    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
+    Mark you,
+    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
+    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
+    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
+    He closes with you in this consequence:
+    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
+    According to the phrase or the addition
+    Of man and country-
+  Rey. Very good, my lord.
+  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
+    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
+  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and  
+    gentleman.'
+  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
+    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
+    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
+    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
+    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
+    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
+    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
+    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
+    See you now-
+    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
+    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
+    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
+    By indirections find directions out.
+    So, by my former lecture and advice,
+    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not
+  Rey. My lord, I have.
+  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
+  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
+  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.  
+  Rey. I shall, my lord.
+  Pol. And let him ply his music.
+  Rey. Well, my lord.
+  Pol. Farewell!
+                                                  Exit Reynaldo.
+
+                       Enter Ophelia.
+
+    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
+  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
+  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I
+  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
+    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
+    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
+    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
+    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
+    And with a look so piteous in purport
+    As if he had been loosed out of hell
+    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
+  Pol. Mad for thy love?  
+  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
+    But truly I do fear it.
+  Pol. What said he?
+  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
+    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
+    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
+    He falls to such perusal of my face
+    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
+    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
+    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
+    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
+    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
+    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
+    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
+    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
+    For out o' doors he went without their help
+    And to the last bended their light on me.
+  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
+    This is the very ecstasy of love,
+    Whose violent property fordoes itself  
+    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
+    As oft as any passion under heaven
+    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
+    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
+  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
+    I did repel his letters and denied
+    His access to me.
+  Pol. That hath made him mad.
+    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
+    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
+    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
+    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
+    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
+    As it is common for the younger sort
+    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
+    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
+    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
+    Come.
+                                                         Exeunt.
+
+Scene II.
+Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
+
+Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, cum aliis.
+
+  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
+    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
+    The need we have to use you did provoke
+    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
+    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
+    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
+    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
+    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
+    So much from th' understanding of himself,
+    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
+    That, being of so young clays brought up with him,
+    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
+    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
+    Some little time; so by your companies
+    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
+    So much as from occasion you may glean,  
+    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
+    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
+  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
+    And sure I am two men there are not living
+    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
+    To show us so much gentry and good will
+    As to expend your time with us awhile
+    For the supply and profit of our hope,
+    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
+    As fits a king's remembrance.
+  Ros. Both your Majesties
+    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
+    Put your dread pleasures more into command
+    Than to entreaty.
+  Guil. But we both obey,
+    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
+    To lay our service freely at your feet,
+    To be commanded.
+  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
+  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.  
+    And I beseech you instantly to visit
+    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
+    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
+  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
+    Pleasant and helpful to him!
+  Queen. Ay, amen!
+                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
+                                                    Attendants].
+
+                         Enter Polonius.
+
+  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
+    Are joyfully return'd.
+  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
+  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
+    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
+    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
+    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
+    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
+    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found  
+    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
+  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
+  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
+    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
+  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
+                                                [Exit Polonius.]
+    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
+    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
+  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
+    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
+  King. Well, we shall sift him.
+
+              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.
+
+    Welcome, my good friends.
+    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
+  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
+    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
+    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
+    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,  
+    But better look'd into, he truly found
+    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
+    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
+    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
+    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
+    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
+    Makes vow before his uncle never more
+    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
+    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
+    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
+    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
+    So levied as before, against the Polack;
+    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
+                                                [Gives a paper.]
+    That it might please you to give quiet pass
+    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
+    On such regards of safety and allowance
+    As therein are set down.
+  King. It likes us well;
+    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,  
+    Answer, and think upon this business.
+    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
+    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
+    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
+  Pol. This business is well ended.
+    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
+    What majesty should be, what duty is,
+    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
+    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
+    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
+    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
+    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
+    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
+    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
+    But let that go.
+  Queen. More matter, with less art.
+  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
+    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
+    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
+    But farewell it, for I will use no art.  
+    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
+    That we find out the cause of this effect-
+    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
+    For this effect defective comes by cause.
+    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
+    Perpend.
+    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
+    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
+    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
+                                             [Reads] the letter.
+    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
+      Ophelia,'-
+
+    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
+      phrase.
+    But you shall hear. Thus:
+                                                        [Reads.]
+    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
+  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
+  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]  
+
+          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
+            Doubt that the sun doth move;
+          Doubt truth to be a liar;
+            But never doubt I love.
+      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to
+    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
+    it. Adieu.
+      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
+                                                          HAMLET.'
+
+    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
+    And more above, hath his solicitings,
+    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
+    All given to mine ear.
+  King. But how hath she
+    Receiv'd his love?
+  Pol. What do you think of me?
+  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
+  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,  
+    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
+    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
+    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
+    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
+    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
+    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
+    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
+    What might you think? No, I went round to work
+    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
+    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
+    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
+    That she should lock herself from his resort,
+    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
+    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
+    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
+    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
+    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
+    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
+    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
+    And all we mourn for.  
+  King. Do you think 'tis this?
+  Queen. it may be, very like.
+  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
+    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
+    When it prov'd otherwise.?
+  King. Not that I know.
+  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this
+      be otherwise.
+    If circumstances lead me, I will find
+    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
+    Within the centre.
+  King. How may we try it further?
+  Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together
+    Here in the lobby.
+  Queen. So he does indeed.
+  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
+    Be you and I behind an arras then.
+    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
+    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
+    Let me be no assistant for a state,  
+    But keep a farm and carters.
+  King. We will try it.
+
+                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.
+
+  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
+  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
+    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
+                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
+    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
+  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
+  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
+  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
+  Pol. Not I, my lord.
+  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
+  Pol. Honest, my lord?
+  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
+    pick'd out of ten thousand.
+  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
+  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god  
+    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
+  Pol. I have, my lord.
+  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
+    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
+  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet
+    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is far
+    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity
+    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you
+    read, my lord?
+  Ham. Words, words, words.
+  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
+  Ham. Between who?
+  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
+  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
+    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
+    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
+    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,
+    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
+    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
+    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.  
+  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.-
+   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
+  Ham. Into my grave?
+  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes
+    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
+    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
+    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
+    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
+    my leave of you.
+  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
+    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my
+    life,
+
+                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
+
+  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
+  Ham. These tedious old fools!
+  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
+  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
+                                                Exit [Polonius].  
+  Guil. My honour'd lord!
+  Ros. My most dear lord!
+  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
+    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
+  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
+  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
+    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
+  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
+  Ros. Neither, my lord.
+  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
+    favours?
+  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
+  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
+    strumpet. What news ?
+  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
+  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
+    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
+    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
+    hither?
+  Guil. Prison, my lord?  
+  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
+  Ros. Then is the world one.
+  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
+    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
+  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
+  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
+    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
+  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your
+    mind.
+  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
+    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
+  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
+    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
+  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
+  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
+    it is but a shadow's shadow.
+  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
+    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my
+    fay, I cannot reason.
+  Both. We'll wait upon you.  
+  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
+    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
+    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what
+    make you at Elsinore?
+  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
+  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
+    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
+    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
+    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak.
+  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
+  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
+    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
+    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen
+    have sent for you.
+  Ros. To what end, my lord?
+  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
+    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
+    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
+    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
+    me, whether you were sent for or no.  
+  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
+  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
+    not off.
+  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
+  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
+    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
+    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my
+    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
+    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
+    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
+    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
+    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing
+    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
+    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
+    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
+    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
+    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what
+    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman
+    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
+  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.  
+  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
+  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
+    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them
+    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
+  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
+    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
+    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
+    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
+    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
+    freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are
+    they?
+  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
+    tragedians of the city.
+  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
+    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
+  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
+    innovation.
+  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
+    city? Are they so follow'd?
+  Ros. No indeed are they not.  
+  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
+  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
+    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
+    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now
+    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
+    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
+    dare scarce come thither.
+  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
+    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
+    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
+    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means
+    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
+    against their own succession.
+  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
+    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a
+    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
+    went to cuffs in the question.
+  Ham. Is't possible?
+  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
+  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?  
+  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
+  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
+    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
+    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
+    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
+    philosophy could find it out.
+
+                     Flourish for the Players.
+
+  Guil. There are the players.
+  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
+    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
+    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
+    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
+    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father
+    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
+  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
+  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
+    know a hawk from a handsaw.
+  
+                            Enter Polonius.
+
+  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
+  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
+    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
+    clouts.
+  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
+    man is twice a child.
+  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
+   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
+  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
+  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
+    Rome-
+  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
+  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
+  Pol. Upon my honour-
+  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
+  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
+    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
+    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene  
+    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
+    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
+    the only men.
+  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
+  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
+  Ham. Why,
+
+         'One fair daughter, and no more,
+           The which he loved passing well.'
+
+  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
+  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
+  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
+    love passing well.
+  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
+  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
+  Ham. Why,
+
+           'As by lot, God wot,'
+
+ and then, you know,
+  
+           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'
+
+    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
+    where my abridgment comes.
+
+                     Enter four or five Players.
+
+    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee
+    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy face is
+    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
+    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
+    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
+    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
+    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are
+    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
+    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a
+    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
+  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
+  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
+    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd  
+    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I
+    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
+    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
+    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
+    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
+    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
+    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
+    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in't
+    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
+    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in
+    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:
+
+         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'
+
+    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:
+
+         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
+         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
+         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
+         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd  
+         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
+         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
+         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
+         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
+         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
+         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
+         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
+         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
+         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
+
+    So, proceed you.
+  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
+     discretion.
+
+  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
+      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
+      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
+      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
+      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
+      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword  
+      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
+      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
+      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
+      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
+      Which was declining on the milky head
+      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
+      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
+      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
+      Did nothing.
+      But, as we often see, against some storm,
+      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
+      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
+      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
+      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
+      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
+      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
+      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
+      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
+      Now falls on Priam.
+      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,  
+      In general synod take away her power;
+      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
+      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
+      As low as to the fiends!
+
+  Pol. This is too long.
+  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
+    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
+    Hecuba.
+
+  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'
+
+  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
+  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
+
+  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
+      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
+      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
+      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
+      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  
+      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
+      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
+      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
+      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
+      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
+      The instant burst of clamour that she made
+      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
+      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
+      And passion in the gods.'
+
+  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
+    eyes. Prithee no more!
+  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
+    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
+    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief
+    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a
+    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
+  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
+  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
+    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own  
+    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in
+    your bounty. Take them in.
+  Pol. Come, sirs.
+  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
+                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
+    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
+    Gonzago'?
+  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
+  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
+    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and
+    insert in't, could you not?
+  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
+  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
+                                            [Exit First Player.]
+    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to
+    Elsinore.
+  Ros. Good my lord!
+  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
+                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
+    Now I am alone.  
+    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
+    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
+    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
+    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
+    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
+    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
+    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
+    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
+    For Hecuba!
+    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
+    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
+    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
+    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
+    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
+    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
+    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
+    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
+    Yet I,
+    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
+    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,  
+    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
+    Upon whose property and most dear life
+    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
+    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
+    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
+    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
+    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
+    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
+    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
+    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
+    I should have fatted all the region kites
+    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
+    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
+    O, vengeance!
+    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
+    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
+    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
+    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
+    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
+    A scullion!  
+    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
+    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
+    Have by the very cunning of the scene
+    Been struck so to the soul that presently
+    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
+    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
+    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
+    Play something like the murther of my father
+    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
+    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
+    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
+    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
+    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
+    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
+    As he is very potent with such spirits,
+    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
+    More relative than this. The play's the thing
+    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

+
+ACT III. Scene I.
+Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
+
+Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Lords.
+
+  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
+    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
+    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
+    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
+  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
+    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
+  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
+    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
+    When we would bring him on to some confession
+    Of his true state.
+  Queen. Did he receive you well?
+  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
+  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
+  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
+    Most free in his reply.
+  Queen. Did you assay him  
+    To any pastime?
+  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
+    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
+    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
+    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
+    And, as I think, they have already order
+    This night to play before him.
+  Pol. 'Tis most true;
+    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
+    To hear and see the matter.
+  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
+    To hear him so inclin'd.
+    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
+    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
+  Ros. We shall, my lord.
+                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
+  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
+    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
+    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
+    Affront Ophelia.  
+    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
+    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
+    We may of their encounter frankly judge
+    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
+    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
+    That thus he suffers for.
+  Queen. I shall obey you;
+    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
+    That your good beauties be the happy cause
+    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
+    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
+    To both your honours.
+  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
+                                                   [Exit Queen.]
+  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
+    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
+    That show of such an exercise may colour
+    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
+    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
+    And pious action we do sugar o'er  
+    The Devil himself.
+  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
+    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
+    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
+    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
+    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
+    O heavy burthen!
+  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
+                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].
+
+                           Enter Hamlet.
+
+  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
+    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
+    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
+    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
+    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
+    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
+    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
+    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation  
+    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
+    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
+    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
+    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
+    Must give us pause. There's the respect
+    That makes calamity of so long life.
+    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
+    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
+    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
+    The insolence of office, and the spurns
+    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
+    When he himself might his quietus make
+    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
+    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
+    But that the dread of something after death-
+    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
+    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
+    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
+    Than fly to others that we know not of?
+    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  
+    And thus the native hue of resolution
+    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
+    And enterprises of great pith and moment
+    With this regard their currents turn awry
+    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
+    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
+    Be all my sins rememb'red.
+  Oph. Good my lord,
+    How does your honour for this many a day?
+  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
+  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
+    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
+    I pray you, now receive them.
+  Ham. No, not I!
+    I never gave you aught.
+  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
+    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
+    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
+    Take these again; for to the noble mind
+    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.  
+    There, my lord.
+  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
+  Oph. My lord?
+  Ham. Are you fair?
+  Oph. What means your lordship?
+  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
+    discourse to your beauty.
+  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
+  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
+    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
+    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,
+    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
+  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
+  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
+    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
+    not.
+  Oph. I was the more deceived.
+  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
+    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse
+    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.  
+    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
+    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
+    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
+    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all;
+    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
+    father?
+  Oph. At home, my lord.
+  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
+    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
+  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
+  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
+    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
+    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
+    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
+    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
+    Farewell.
+  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
+  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
+    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you
+    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make your  
+    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made
+    me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages. Those that are
+    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as
+    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
+  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
+    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
+    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
+    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
+    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
+    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
+    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
+    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
+    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
+    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
+    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
+    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
+
+                   Enter King and Polonius.
+
+  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;  
+    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
+    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
+    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
+    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
+    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
+    I have in quick determination
+    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
+    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
+    Haply the seas, and countries different,
+    With variable objects, shall expel
+    This something-settled matter in his heart,
+    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
+    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
+  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
+    The origin and commencement of his grief
+    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
+    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
+    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
+    But if you hold it fit, after the play
+    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him  
+    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
+    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
+    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
+    To England send him; or confine him where
+    Your wisdom best shall think.
+  King. It shall be so.
+    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.
+

+
+
+Scene II.
+Elsinore. hall in the Castle.
+
+Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.
+
+  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
+    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
+    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
+    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
+    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
+    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
+    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
+    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
+    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who
+    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
+    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
+    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
+  Player. I warrant your honour.
+  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
+    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
+    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
+    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,  
+    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
+    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature,
+    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
+    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though
+    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
+    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
+    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
+    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to
+    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
+    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
+    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
+    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
+    humanity so abominably.
+  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
+  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
+    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
+    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
+    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary
+    question of the play be then to be considered. That's villanous
+    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go  
+    make you ready.
+                                                 Exeunt Players.
+
+            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.
+
+    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
+  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
+  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
+    help to hasten them?
+  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
+  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!
+
+                      Enter Horatio.
+
+  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
+  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
+    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
+  Hor. O, my dear lord!
+  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
+    For what advancement may I hope from thee,  
+    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
+    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
+    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
+    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
+    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
+    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
+    And could of men distinguish, her election
+    Hath scald thee for herself. For thou hast been
+    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
+    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
+    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
+    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
+    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
+    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
+    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
+    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
+    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
+    There is a play to-night before the King.
+    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
+    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.  
+    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
+    Even with the very comment of thy soul
+    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
+    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
+    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
+    And my imaginations are as foul
+    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
+    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
+    And after we will both our judgments join
+    In censure of his seeming.
+  Hor. Well, my lord.
+    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
+    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
+
+    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
+    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
+      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
+                       carrying torches.
+
+  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.  
+    Get you a place.
+  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
+  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
+    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
+  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not
+    mine.
+  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
+    i' th' university, you say?
+  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
+  Ham. What did you enact?
+  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol; Brutus
+    kill'd me.
+  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
+    the players ready.
+  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
+  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
+  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
+  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
+  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
+                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]  
+  Oph. No, my lord.
+  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
+  Oph. Ay, my lord.
+  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
+  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
+  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
+  Oph. What is, my lord?
+  Ham. Nothing.
+  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
+  Ham. Who, I?
+  Oph. Ay, my lord.
+  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
+    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
+    within 's two hours.
+  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
+  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
+    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten
+    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
+    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or else
+    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose  
+    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'
+
+               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.
+
+    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
+    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
+    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
+    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
+    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
+    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
+    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
+    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes,
+    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
+    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
+    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
+    his love.
+                                                         Exeunt.
+
+  Oph. What means this, my lord?
+  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.  
+  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
+
+                      Enter Prologue.
+
+  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
+    they'll tell all.
+  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
+  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
+    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
+  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.
+
+    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
+      Here stooping to your clemency,
+      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]
+
+  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
+  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
+  Ham. As woman's love.
+
+              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.  
+
+    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
+      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
+      And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
+      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
+      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
+      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
+    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
+      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
+      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
+      So far from cheer and from your former state.
+      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
+      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
+      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
+      In neither aught, or in extremity.
+      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
+      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
+      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
+      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
+    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;  
+      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
+      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
+      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
+      For husband shalt thou-
+    Queen. O, confound the rest!
+      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
+      When second husband let me be accurst!
+      None wed the second but who killed the first.
+
+  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
+
+    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
+      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
+      A second time I kill my husband dead
+      When second husband kisses me in bed.
+    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
+      But what we do determine oft we break.
+      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
+      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
+      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,  
+      But fill unshaken when they mellow be.
+      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
+      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
+      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
+      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
+      The violence of either grief or joy
+      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
+      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
+      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
+      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
+      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
+      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
+      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
+      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
+      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
+      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
+      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
+      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
+      Directly seasons him his enemy.
+      But, orderly to end where I begun,  
+      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
+      That our devices still are overthrown;
+      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
+      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
+      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
+    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
+      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
+      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
+      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
+      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
+      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
+      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
+      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
+
+  Ham. If she should break it now!
+
+    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
+      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
+      The tedious day with sleep.
+    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,  
+                                                    [He] sleeps.
+      And never come mischance between us twain!
+Exit.
+
+  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
+  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
+  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
+  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
+  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
+    world.
+  King. What do you call the play?
+  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
+    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's name;
+    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece of
+    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
+    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our withers
+    are unwrung.
+
+                         Enter Lucianus.
+  
+    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
+  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
+  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
+    the puppets dallying.
+  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
+  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
+  Oph. Still better, and worse.
+  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
+    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
+    bellow for revenge.
+
+    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
+      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
+      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
+      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
+      Thy natural magic and dire property
+      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
+                                   Pours the poison in his ears.
+
+  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.  
+    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
+    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
+  Oph. The King rises.
+  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
+  Queen. How fares my lord?
+  Pol. Give o'er the play.
+  King. Give me some light! Away!
+  All. Lights, lights, lights!
+                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
+  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
+          The hart ungalled play;
+         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
+          Thus runs the world away.
+    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of my
+    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my raz'd
+    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
+  Hor. Half a share.
+  Ham.   A whole one I!
+         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
+           This realm dismantled was  
+         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
+           A very, very- pajock.
+  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
+  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
+    pound! Didst perceive?
+  Hor. Very well, my lord.
+  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
+  Hor. I did very well note him.
+  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
+         For if the King like not the comedy,
+         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
+    Come, some music!
+
+                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
+
+  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
+  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
+  Guil. The King, sir-
+  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
+  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.  
+  Ham. With drink, sir?
+  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
+  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
+    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
+    plunge him into far more choler.
+  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
+    not so wildly from my affair.
+  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
+  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit
+    hath sent me to you.
+  Ham. You are welcome.
+  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
+    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
+    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
+    shall be the end of my business.
+  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
+  Guil. What, my lord?
+  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
+    answer is I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
+    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother, you  
+    say-
+  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
+    amazement and admiration.
+  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
+    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
+  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
+  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
+    further trade with us?
+  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
+  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
+  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely
+    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to
+    your friend.
+  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
+  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself
+    for your succession in Denmark?
+  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
+    musty.
+
+                     Enter the Players with recorders.  
+
+    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do
+    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me
+    into a toil?
+  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
+  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
+  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
+  Ham. I pray you.
+  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
+  Ham. I do beseech you.
+  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
+  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
+    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will
+    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
+  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
+    have not the skill.
+  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
+    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
+    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
+    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,  
+    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
+    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than a
+    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
+    you cannot play upon me.
+
+                        Enter Polonius.
+
+    God bless you, sir!
+  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
+  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
+  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
+  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
+  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
+  Ham. Or like a whale.
+  Pol. Very like a whale.
+  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the
+    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
+  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
+  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
+                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]  
+    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
+    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
+    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
+    And do such bitter business as the day
+    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
+    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
+    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
+    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
+    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
+    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
+    How in my words somever she be shent,
+    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.
+
+
+
+
+Scene III.
+A room in the Castle.
+
+Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.
+
+  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
+    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
+    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
+    And he to England shall along with you.
+    The terms of our estate may not endure
+    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
+    Out of his lunacies.
+  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
+    Most holy and religious fear it is
+    To keep those many many bodies safe
+    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
+  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
+    With all the strength and armour of the mind
+    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
+    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
+    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
+    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw  
+    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
+    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
+    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
+    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
+    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
+    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
+    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
+  King. Arm you, I pray you, to th', speedy voyage;
+    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
+    Which now goes too free-footed.
+  Both. We will haste us.
+                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.
+
+                   Enter Polonius.
+
+  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
+    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
+    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
+    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
+    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,  
+    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
+    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
+    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
+    And tell you what I know.
+  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
+                                                Exit [Polonius].
+    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
+    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
+    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
+    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
+    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
+    And, like a man to double business bound,
+    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
+    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
+    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
+    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
+    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
+    But to confront the visage of offence?
+    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
+    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,  
+    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
+    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
+    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
+    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
+    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
+    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
+    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
+    In the corrupted currents of this world
+    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
+    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
+    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
+    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
+    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
+    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
+    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
+    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
+    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
+    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
+    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
+    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.  
+    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
+    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
+    All may be well.                                  He kneels.
+
+                         Enter Hamlet.
+
+  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
+    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
+    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
+    A villain kills my father; and for that,
+    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
+    To heaven.
+    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
+    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
+    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
+    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
+    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
+    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
+    To take him in the purging of his soul,
+    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?  
+    No.
+    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
+    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
+    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
+    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
+    That has no relish of salvation in't-
+    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
+    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
+    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
+    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
+  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
+    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.
+
+
+
+
+Scene IV.
+The Queen's closet.
+
+Enter Queen and Polonius.
+
+  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
+    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
+    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
+    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
+    Pray you be round with him.
+  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
+  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him coming.
+                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]
+
+                          Enter Hamlet.
+
+  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
+  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
+  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
+  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
+  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
+  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?  
+  Ham. What's the matter now?
+  Queen. Have you forgot me?
+  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
+    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
+    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
+  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
+  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge I
+    You go not till I set you up a glass
+    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
+  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
+    Help, help, ho!
+  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
+  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
+            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
+  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
+  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
+  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
+  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
+  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
+    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.  
+  Queen. As kill a king?
+  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
+                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
+    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
+    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
+    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
+    Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! sit you down
+    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
+    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
+    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
+    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
+  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
+    In noise so rude against me?
+  Ham. Such an act
+    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
+    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
+    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
+    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
+    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
+    As from the body of contraction plucks  
+    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
+    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
+    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
+    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
+    Is thought-sick at the act.
+  Queen. Ay me, what act,
+    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
+  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
+    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
+    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
+    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
+    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
+    A station like the herald Mercury
+    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
+    A combination and a form indeed
+    Where every god did seem to set his seal
+    To give the world assurance of a man.
+    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
+    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
+    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?  
+    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
+    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
+    You cannot call it love; for at your age
+    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
+    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
+    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
+    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
+    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
+    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
+    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
+    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
+    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
+    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
+    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
+    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
+    Could not so mope.
+    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
+    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
+    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
+    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame  
+    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
+    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
+    And reason panders will.
+  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
+    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
+    And there I see such black and grained spots
+    As will not leave their tinct.
+  Ham. Nay, but to live
+    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
+    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
+    Over the nasty sty!
+  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
+    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
+    No more, sweet Hamlet!
+  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
+    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
+    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
+    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
+    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
+    And put it in his pocket!  
+  Queen. No more!
+
+                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.
+
+  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
+    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
+    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
+  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
+  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
+    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
+    Th' important acting of your dread command?
+    O, say!
+  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
+    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
+    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
+    O, step between her and her fighting soul
+    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
+    Speak to her, Hamlet.
+  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
+  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,  
+    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
+    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
+    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
+    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
+    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
+    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
+    Upon the beat and flame of thy distemper
+    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
+  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
+    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
+    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
+    Lest with this piteous action you convert
+    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
+    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
+  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
+  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
+  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
+  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
+  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
+  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!  
+    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
+    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
+                                                     Exit Ghost.
+  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
+    This bodiless creation ecstasy
+    Is very cunning in.
+  Ham. Ecstasy?
+    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
+    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
+    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
+    And I the matter will reword; which madness
+    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
+    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
+    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
+    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
+    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
+    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
+    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
+    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
+    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;  
+    For in the fatness of these pursy times
+    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
+    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
+  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
+  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
+    And live the purer with the other half,
+    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
+    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
+    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
+    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
+    That to the use of actions fair and good
+    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
+    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
+    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
+    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
+    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
+    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
+    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
+    And when you are desirous to be blest,
+    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,  
+    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
+    To punish me with this, and this with me,
+    That I must be their scourge and minister.
+    I will bestow him, and will answer well
+    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
+    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
+    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
+    One word more, good lady.
+  Queen. What shall I do?
+  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
+    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
+    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
+    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
+    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
+    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
+    That I essentially am not in madness,
+    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
+    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
+    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
+    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?  
+    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
+    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
+    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
+    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
+    And break your own neck down.
+  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
+    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
+    What thou hast said to me.
+  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
+  Queen. Alack,
+    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
+  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
+    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
+    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
+    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
+    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
+    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
+    But I will delve one yard below their mines
+    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
+    When in one line two crafts directly meet.  
+    This man shall set me packing.
+    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
+    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
+    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
+    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
+    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
+    Good night, mother.
+                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
+                                                       Polonius.

+
+ACT IV. Scene I.
+Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
+
+Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
+
+  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
+    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
+    Where is your son?
+  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
+                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
+    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
+  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
+  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
+    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
+    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
+    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
+    And in this brainish apprehension kills
+    The unseen good old man.
+  King. O heavy deed!
+    It had been so with us, had we been there.
+    His liberty is full of threats to all-
+    To you yourself, to us, to every one.  
+    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
+    It will be laid to us, whose providence
+    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
+    This mad young man. But so much was our love
+    We would not understand what was most fit,
+    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
+    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
+    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
+  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
+    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
+    Among a mineral of metals base,
+    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
+  King. O Gertrude, come away!
+    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
+    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
+    We must with all our majesty and skill
+    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
+
+             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
+  
+    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
+    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
+    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
+    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
+    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
+                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
+    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
+    And let them know both what we mean to do
+    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
+    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
+    As level as the cannon to his blank,
+    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
+    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
+    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
+                                                         Exeunt.
+
+
+
+
+Scene II.
+Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.
+
+Enter Hamlet.
+
+  Ham. Safely stow'd.
+  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
+  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
+
+               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
+
+  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
+  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
+  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
+    And bear it to the chapel.
+  Ham. Do not believe it.
+  Ros. Believe what?
+  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
+    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son
+    of a king?
+  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
+  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,  
+    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in
+    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;
+    first mouth'd, to be last Swallowed. When he needs what you have
+    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry
+    again.
+  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
+  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
+  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
+    the King.
+  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
+    The King is a thing-
+  Guil. A thing, my lord?
+  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
+                                                         Exeunt.
+
+
+
+
+Scene III.
+Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
+
+Enter King.
+
+  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
+    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
+    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
+    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
+    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
+    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
+    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
+    This sudden sending him away must seem
+    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
+    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
+    Or not at all.
+
+                    Enter Rosencrantz.
+
+    How now O What hath befall'n?
+  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
+    We cannot get from him.  
+  King. But where is he?
+  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
+  King. Bring him before us.
+  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
+
+        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].
+
+  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
+  Ham. At supper.
+  King. At supper? Where?
+  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
+    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your
+    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and
+    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar
+    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's the
+    end.
+  King. Alas, alas!
+  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
+    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
+  King. What dost thou mean by this?  
+  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
+    the guts of a beggar.
+  King. Where is Polonius?
+  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
+    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if you
+    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up
+    the stair, into the lobby.
+  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
+  Ham. He will stay till you come.
+                                            [Exeunt Attendants.]
+  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
+    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
+    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
+    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
+    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
+    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
+    For England.
+  Ham. For England?
+  King. Ay, Hamlet.
+  Ham. Good.  
+  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
+  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
+    Farewell, dear mother.
+  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
+  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
+    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
+Exit.
+  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
+    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
+    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
+    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
+                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
+    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
+    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
+    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
+    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
+    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
+    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
+    By letters congruing to that effect,
+    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;  
+    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
+    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
+    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.
+
+
+
+
+
+Scene IV.
+Near Elsinore.
+
+Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.
+
+  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
+    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
+    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
+    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
+    if that his Majesty would aught with us,
+    We shall express our duty in his eye;
+    And let him know so.
+  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
+  For. Go softly on.
+                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain].
+
+       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.
+
+  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
+  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
+  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
+  Capt. Against some part of Poland.  
+  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
+  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
+  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
+    Or for some frontier?
+  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
+    We go to gain a little patch of ground
+    That hath in it no profit but the name.
+    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
+    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
+    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
+  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
+  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
+  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
+    Will not debate the question of this straw.
+    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
+    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
+    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
+  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
+  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
+  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.  
+                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
+    How all occasions do inform against me
+    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
+    If his chief good and market of his time
+    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
+    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
+    Looking before and after, gave us not
+    That capability and godlike reason
+    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
+    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
+    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
+    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
+    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
+    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
+    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
+    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
+    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
+    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
+    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
+    Makes mouths at the invisible event,  
+    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
+    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
+    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
+    Is not to stir without great argument,
+    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
+    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
+    That have a father klll'd, a mother stain'd,
+    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
+    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
+    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
+    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
+    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
+    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
+    Which is not tomb enough and continent
+    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
+    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.
+
+
+
+
+
+Scene V.
+Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
+
+Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.
+
+  Queen. I will not speak with her.
+  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
+    Her mood will needs be pitied.
+  Queen. What would she have?
+  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
+    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
+    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
+    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
+    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
+    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
+    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
+    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
+    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
+    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
+  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
+    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
+  Queen. Let her come in.  
+                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
+    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
+    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
+    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
+    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
+
+                 Enter Ophelia distracted.
+
+  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
+  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
+  Oph. (sings)
+         How should I your true-love know
+           From another one?
+         By his cockle bat and' staff
+           And his sandal shoon.
+
+  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
+  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.
+
+    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,  
+              He is dead and gone;
+            At his head a grass-green turf,
+              At his heels a stone.
+
+    O, ho!
+  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
+  Oph. Pray you mark.
+
+    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-
+
+                    Enter King.
+
+  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
+  Oph. (Sings)
+           Larded all with sweet flowers;
+         Which bewept to the grave did not go
+           With true-love showers.
+
+  King. How do you, pretty lady?
+  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.  
+    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
+    your table!
+  King. Conceit upon her father.
+  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what
+    it means, say you this:
+
+    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
+              All in the morning bedtime,
+            And I a maid at your window,
+              To be your Valentine.
+
+            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
+              And dupp'd the chamber door,
+            Let in the maid, that out a maid
+              Never departed more.
+
+  King. Pretty Ophelia!
+  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!
+
+    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,  
+              Alack, and fie for shame!
+            Young men will do't if they come to't
+              By Cock, they are to blame.
+
+            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
+              You promis'd me to wed.'
+
+    He answers:
+
+            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
+              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'
+
+  King. How long hath she been thus?
+  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
+    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground.
+    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
+    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night, sweet
+    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
+  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
+                                                 [Exit Horatio.]  
+    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
+    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
+    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
+    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
+    Next, Your son gone, and he most violent author
+    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
+    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
+    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
+    In hugger-mugger to inter him; Poor Ophelia
+    Divided from herself and her fair-judgment,
+    Without the which we are Pictures or mere beasts;
+    Last, and as such containing as all these,
+    Her brother is in secret come from France;
+    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
+    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
+    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
+    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
+    Will nothing stick Our person to arraign
+    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
+    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places  
+    Give, me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
+  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
+  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
+
+                     Enter a Messenger.
+
+    What is the matter?
+  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
+    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
+    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
+    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
+    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
+    And, as the world were now but to begin,
+    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
+    The ratifiers and props of every word,
+    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
+    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
+    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
+                                                 A noise within.
+  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!  
+    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
+  King. The doors are broke.
+
+                    Enter Laertes with others.
+
+  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
+  All. No, let's come in!
+  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
+  All. We will, we will!
+  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
+    O thou vile king,
+    Give me my father!
+  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
+  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
+    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
+    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
+    Of my true mother.
+  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
+    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
+    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.  
+    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
+    That treason can but peep to what it would,
+    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
+    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
+    Speak, man.
+  Laer. Where is my father?
+  King. Dead.
+  Queen. But not by him!
+  King. Let him demand his fill.
+  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
+    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
+    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
+    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
+    That both the world, I give to negligence,
+    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
+    Most throughly for my father.
+  King. Who shall stay you?
+  Laer. My will, not all the world!
+    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
+    They shall go far with little.  
+  King. Good Laertes,
+    If you desire to know the certainty
+    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in Your revenge
+    That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe,
+    Winner and loser?
+  Laer. None but his enemies.
+  King. Will you know them then?
+  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
+    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
+    Repast them with my blood.
+  King. Why, now You speak
+    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
+    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
+    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
+    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
+    As day does to your eye.
+                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
+  Laer. How now? What noise is that?
+
+                      Enter Ophelia.  
+
+    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
+    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
+    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
+    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
+    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
+    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
+    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
+    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
+    It sends some precious instance of itself
+    After the thing it loves.
+
+  Oph. (sings)
+         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
+           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
+         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.
+
+    Fare you well, my dove!
+  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
+    It could not move thus.  
+  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,
+    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his
+    master's daughter.
+  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
+  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
+    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
+  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
+  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
+    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays.
+    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I
+    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my father
+    died. They say he made a good end.
+
+    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
+
+  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
+    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
+  Oph. (sings)
+         And will he not come again?
+         And will he not come again?
+           No, no, he is dead;  
+           Go to thy deathbed;
+         He never will come again.
+
+         His beard was as white as snow,
+         All flaxen was his poll.
+           He is gone, he is gone,
+           And we cast away moan.
+         God 'a'mercy on his soul!
+
+    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi', you.
+Exit.
+  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
+  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
+    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
+    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
+    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
+    If by direct or by collateral hand
+    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
+    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
+    To you in satisfaction; but if not,  
+    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
+    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
+    To give it due content.
+  Laer. Let this be so.
+    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
+    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
+    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
+    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
+    That I must call't in question.
+  King. So you shall;
+    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
+    I pray you go with me.
+                                                          Exeunt
+
+
+
+
+
+Scene VI.
+Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.
+
+Enter Horatio with an Attendant.
+
+  Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
+  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for you.
+  Hor. Let them come in.
+                                               [Exit Attendant.]
+    I do not know from what part of the world
+    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
+
+                          Enter Sailors.
+
+  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
+  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
+  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
+    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for England- if
+    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
+  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd
+    this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have
+    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of  
+    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
+    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I
+    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
+    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves
+    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for
+    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou
+    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words
+    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
+    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring
+    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course
+    for England. Of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
+                            'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
+
+    Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
+    And do't the speedier that you may direct me
+    To him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.
+
+
+
+
+
+Scene VII.
+Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.
+
+Enter King and Laertes.
+
+  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
+    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
+    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
+    That he which hath your noble father slain
+    Pursued my life.
+  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
+    Why you proceeded not against these feats
+    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
+    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
+    You mainly were stirr'd up.
+  King. O, for two special reasons,
+    Which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinew'd,
+    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
+    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
+    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
+    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
+    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,  
+    I could not but by her. The other motive
+    Why to a public count I might not go
+    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
+    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
+    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
+    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
+    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
+    Would have reverted to my bow again,
+    And not where I had aim'd them.
+  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
+    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
+    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
+    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
+    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
+  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
+    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
+    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
+    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
+    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
+    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-  
+
+                 Enter a Messenger with letters.
+
+    How now? What news?
+  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
+    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
+  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
+  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
+    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
+    Of him that brought them.
+  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
+    Leave us.
+                                                 Exit Messenger.
+    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on your
+    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
+    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
+    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
+                                                     'HAMLET.'
+    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
+    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?  
+  Laer. Know you the hand?
+  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
+    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
+    Can you advise me?
+  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
+    It warms the very sickness in my heart
+    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
+    'Thus didest thou.'
+  King. If it be so, Laertes
+    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
+    Will you be rul'd by me?
+  Laer. Ay my lord,
+    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
+  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
+    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
+    No more to undertake it, I will work him
+    To exploit now ripe in my device,
+    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
+    And for his death no wind
+    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice  
+    And call it accident.
+  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
+    The rather, if you could devise it so
+    That I might be the organ.
+  King. It falls right.
+    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
+    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
+    Wherein they say you shine, Your sun of parts
+    Did not together pluck such envy from him
+    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
+    Of the unworthiest siege.
+  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
+  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
+    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
+    The light and careless livery that it wears
+    Thin settled age his sables and his weeds,
+    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
+    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
+    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
+    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant  
+    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
+    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
+    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
+    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
+    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
+    Come short of what he did.
+  Laer. A Norman was't?
+  King. A Norman.
+  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
+  King. The very same.
+  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
+    And gem of all the nation.
+  King. He made confession of you;
+    And gave you such a masterly report
+    For art and exercise in your defence,
+    And for your rapier most especially,
+    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
+    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
+    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
+    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his  
+    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
+    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
+    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
+    Now, out of this-
+  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
+  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
+    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
+    A face without a heart,'
+  Laer. Why ask you this?
+  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
+    But that I know love is begun by time,
+    And that I see, in passages of proof,
+    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
+    There lives within the very flame of love
+    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
+    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
+    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
+    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
+    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
+    And hath abatements and delays as many  
+    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
+    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
+    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
+    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
+    To show yourself your father's son in deed
+    More than in words?
+  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
+  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
+    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
+    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
+    Will return'd shall know you are come home.
+    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
+    And set a double varnish on the fame
+    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
+    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
+    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
+    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
+    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
+    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
+    Requite him for your father.  
+  Laer. I will do't!
+    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
+    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
+    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
+    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
+    Collected from all simples that have virtue
+    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
+    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
+    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
+    It may be death.
+  King. Let's further think of this,
+    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
+    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
+    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
+    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
+    Should have a back or second, that might hold
+    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
+    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
+    I ha't!
+    When in your motion you are hot and dry-  
+    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
+    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
+    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
+    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
+    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,
+
+                           Enter Queen.
+
+    How now, sweet queen?
+  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
+    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
+  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
+  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
+    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
+    There with fantastic garlands did she come
+    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
+    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
+    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
+    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
+    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,  
+    When down her weedy trophies and herself
+    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
+    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
+    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
+    As one incapable of her own distress,
+    Or like a creature native and indued
+    Unto that element; but long it could not be
+    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
+    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
+    To muddy death.
+  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
+  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
+  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
+    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
+    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
+    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
+    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
+    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
+    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
+  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.  
+    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
+    Now fear I this will give it start again;
+    Therefore let's follow.
+                                                         Exeunt.

+
+ACT V. Scene I.
+Elsinore. A churchyard.
+
+Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].
+
+  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
+    seeks her own salvation?
+  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
+    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
+  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
+    defence?
+  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
+  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies
+    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and an
+    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
+    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
+  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
+  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the
+    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
+    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water come to
+    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not
+    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.  
+  Other. But is this law?
+  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
+  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
+    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.
+  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great folk
+    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang themselves
+    more than their even-Christen. Come, my spade! There is no
+    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They
+    hold up Adam's profession.
+  Other. Was he a gentleman?
+  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
+  Other. Why, he had none.
+  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
+    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll
+    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
+    purpose, confess thyself-
+  Other. Go to!
+  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
+    shipwright, or the carpenter?
+  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand  
+    tenants.
+  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well.
+    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
+    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
+    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come!
+  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
+    carpenter?
+  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
+  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
+  Clown. To't.
+  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.
+
+                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.
+
+  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will
+    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
+    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
+    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
+    liquor.
+                                            [Exit Second Clown.]  
+
+                       [Clown digs and] sings.
+
+       In youth when I did love, did love,
+         Methought it was very sweet;
+       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
+         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
+
+  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
+    grave-making?
+  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a Property of easiness.
+  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier
+    sense.
+  Clown. (sings)
+         But age with his stealing steps
+           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
+         And hath shipped me intil the land,
+           As if I had never been such.
+                                            [Throws up a skull.]
+  
+  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
+    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that
+    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a Politician,
+    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,
+    might it not?
+  Hor. It might, my lord.
+  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
+    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that
+    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it- might
+    it not?
+  Hor. Ay, my lord.
+  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd
+    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution,
+    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the
+    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
+    on't.
+  Clown. (Sings)
+         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
+           For and a shrouding sheet;
+         O, a Pit of clay for to be made  
+           For such a guest is meet.
+                                      Throws up [another skull].
+
+  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
+    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
+    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock
+    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
+    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a
+    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his
+    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of
+    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
+    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of
+    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
+    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will
+    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have no
+    more, ha?
+  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
+  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
+  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
+  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I  
+    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
+  Clown. Mine, sir.
+
+    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
+              For such a guest is meet.
+
+  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
+  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
+    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
+  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for
+    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
+  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
+  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
+  Clown. For no man, sir.
+  Ham. What woman then?
+  Clown. For none neither.
+  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
+  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
+  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
+    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three years
+    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe  
+    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls
+    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
+  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that our
+    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
+  Ham. How long is that since?
+  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the
+    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
+    into England.
+  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
+  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits there;
+    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
+  Ham. Why?
+  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as mad as
+    he.
+  Ham. How came he mad?
+  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
+  Ham. How strangely?
+  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
+  Ham. Upon what ground?
+  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy  
+    thirty years.
+  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
+  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have many
+    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in, I
+    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last
+    you nine year.
+  Ham. Why he more than another?
+  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a will
+    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of
+    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath lien
+    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
+  Ham. Whose was it?
+  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it was?
+  Ham. Nay, I know not.
+  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon of
+    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
+    skull, the King's jester.
+  Ham. This?
+  Clown. E'en that.
+  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,  
+    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He
+    hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes. And now how abhorred
+    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those
+    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes
+    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
+    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your
+    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
+    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
+    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio,
+    tell me one thing.
+  Hor. What's that, my lord?
+  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
+  Hor. E'en so.
+  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
+                                          [Puts down the skull.]
+  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
+  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
+    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
+    stopping a bunghole?
+  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.  
+  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
+    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
+    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
+    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto he
+    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
+    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
+    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
+    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
+    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
+    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-
+
+    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
+             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]
+
+    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
+    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
+    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
+    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
+    Couch we awhile, and mark.
+                                         [Retires with Horatio.]  
+  Laer. What ceremony else?
+  Ham. That is Laertes,
+    A very noble youth. Mark.
+  Laer. What ceremony else?
+  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
+    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
+    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
+    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
+    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
+    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
+    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
+    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
+    Of bell and burial.
+  Laer. Must there no more be done?
+  Priest. No more be done.
+    We should profane the service of the dead
+    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
+    As to peace-parted souls.
+  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
+    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  
+    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
+    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
+    When thou liest howling.
+  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
+  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
+                                             [Scatters flowers.]
+    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
+    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
+    And not have strew'd thy grave.
+  Laer. O, treble woe
+    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
+    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
+    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
+    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
+                                             Leaps in the grave.
+    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
+    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
+    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
+    Of blue Olympus.
+  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief  
+    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
+    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
+    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
+    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
+  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
+                                            [Grapples with him].
+  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
+    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
+    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
+    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
+    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
+  King. Pluck thein asunder.
+  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
+  All. Gentlemen!
+  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
+             [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
+                                                         grave.]
+  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
+    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
+  Queen. O my son, what theme?  
+  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
+    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
+    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
+  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
+  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
+  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
+    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
+    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
+    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
+    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
+    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
+    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
+    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
+    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
+    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
+    I'll rant as well as thou.
+  Queen. This is mere madness;
+    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
+    Anon, as patient as the female dove
+    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,  
+    His silence will sit drooping.
+  Ham. Hear you, sir!
+    What is the reason that you use me thus?
+    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
+    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
+    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
+Exit.
+  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
+                                                   Exit Horatio.
+    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech.
+    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
+    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
+    This grave shall have a living monument.
+    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
+    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
+                                                         Exeunt.
+
+
+
+
+Scene II.
+Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.
+
+Enter Hamlet and Horatio.
+
+  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
+    You do remember all the circumstance?
+  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
+  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
+    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
+    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
+    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
+    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
+    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
+    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
+    Rough-hew them how we will-
+  Hor. That is most certain.
+  Ham. Up from my cabin,
+    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
+    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
+    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
+    To mine own room again; making so bold  
+    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
+    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
+    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
+    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
+    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
+    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
+    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
+    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
+    My head should be struck off.
+  Hor. Is't possible?
+  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
+    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
+  Hor. I beseech you.
+  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
+    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
+    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
+    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
+    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
+    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
+    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now  
+    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
+    Th' effect of what I wrote?
+  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
+  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
+    As England was his faithful tributary,
+    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
+    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
+    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
+    And many such-like as's of great charge,
+    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
+    Without debatement further, more or less,
+    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
+    Not shriving time allow'd.
+  Hor. How was this seal'd?
+  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
+    I had my father's signet in my purse,
+    which was the model of that Danish seal;
+    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
+    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
+    The changeling never known. Now, the next day  
+    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
+    Thou know'st already.
+  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
+  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
+    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
+    Does by their own insinuation grow.
+    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
+    Between the pass and fell incensed points
+    Of mighty opposites.
+  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
+  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
+    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
+    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
+    Thrown out his angle for my Proper life,
+    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
+    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
+    To let this canker of our nature come
+    In further evil?
+  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
+    What is the issue of the business there.  
+  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
+    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
+    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
+    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
+    For by the image of my cause I see
+    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
+    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
+    Into a tow'ring passion.
+  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?
+
+                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.
+
+  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
+  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
+    waterfly?
+  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
+  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
+    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be
+    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess. 'Tis
+    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.  
+  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart
+    a thing to you from his Majesty.
+  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
+    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
+  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
+  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
+  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
+  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
+  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot
+    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that
+    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter-
+  Ham. I beseech you remember.
+                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
+  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is
+    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman,
+    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
+    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card
+    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of
+    what part a gentleman would see.
+  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I  
+    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of
+    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
+    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
+    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
+    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
+    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
+  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
+  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
+    rawer breath
+  Osr. Sir?
+  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in another
+    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
+  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman
+  Osr. Of Laertes?
+  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
+    spent.
+  Ham. Of him, sir.
+  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
+  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
+    much approve me. Well, sir?  
+  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
+  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
+    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
+  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him
+    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
+  Ham. What's his weapon?
+  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
+  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
+  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
+    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
+    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
+    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
+    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
+    very liberal conceit.
+  Ham. What call you the carriages?
+  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent
+    ere you had done.
+  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
+  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
+    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.  
+    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
+    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the French
+    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call it?
+  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
+    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
+    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
+    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
+  Ham. How if I answer no?
+  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
+  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
+    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
+    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose,
+    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
+    shame and the odd hits.
+  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
+  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
+  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
+  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
+    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
+  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.  
+  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
+    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes
+    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter-
+    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
+    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
+    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,
+
+                            Enter a Lord.
+
+  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who
+    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to
+    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will
+    take longer time.
+  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
+    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
+    I be so able as now.
+  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
+  Ham. In happy time.
+  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
+    Laertes before you fall to play.  
+  Ham. She well instructs me.
+                                                    [Exit Lord.]
+  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
+  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in
+    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
+    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
+  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
+  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
+    would perhaps trouble a woman.
+  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their
+    repair hither and say you are not fit.
+  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
+    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come', if it be
+    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
+    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he leaves,
+    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.
+
+    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
+              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
+               A table and flagons of wine on it.  
+
+  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
+                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
+  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
+    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
+    This presence knows,
+    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
+    With sore distraction. What I have done
+    That might your nature, honour, and exception
+    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
+    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
+    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
+    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
+    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
+    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
+    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
+    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
+    Sir, in this audience,
+    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
+    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts  
+    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
+    And hurt my brother.
+  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
+    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
+    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
+    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
+    Till by some elder masters of known honour
+    I have a voice and precedent of peace
+    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
+    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
+    And will not wrong it.
+  Ham. I embrace it freely,
+    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
+    Give us the foils. Come on.
+  Laer. Come, one for me.
+  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
+    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
+    Stick fiery off indeed.
+  Laer. You mock me, sir.
+  Ham. No, by this bad.  
+  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
+    You know the wager?
+  Ham. Very well, my lord.
+    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
+  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
+    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
+  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
+  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
+                                                Prepare to play.
+  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
+  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
+    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
+    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
+    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
+    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
+    And in the cup an union shall he throw
+    Richer than that which four successive kings
+    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
+    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
+    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,  
+    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
+    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
+    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
+  Ham. Come on, sir.
+  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
+  Ham. One.
+  Laer. No.
+  Ham. Judgment!
+  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
+  Laer. Well, again!
+  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
+    Here's to thy health.
+               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
+    Give him the cup.
+  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
+    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
+  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
+  King. Our son shall win.
+  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
+    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.  
+    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
+  Ham. Good madam!
+  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
+  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
+  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
+  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
+  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
+  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
+  King. I do not think't.
+  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
+  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
+    pray You Pass with your best violence;
+    I am afeard You make a wanton of me.
+  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
+  Osr. Nothing neither way.
+  Laer. Have at you now!
+                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
+                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
+  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
+  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.  
+  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
+  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
+  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
+  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
+    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
+  Ham. How does the Queen?
+  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
+  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
+    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
+  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
+    Treachery! Seek it out.
+                                                [Laertes falls.]
+  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
+    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
+    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
+    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
+    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
+    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
+    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
+    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.  
+  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
+    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
+  All. Treason! treason!
+  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
+  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
+    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
+    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
+  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
+    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
+    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
+    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
+    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
+  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
+    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
+    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
+    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
+    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
+    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
+    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
+    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright  
+    To the unsatisfied.
+  Hor. Never believe it.
+    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
+    Here's yet some liquor left.
+  Ham. As th'art a man,
+    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
+    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
+    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
+    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
+    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
+    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
+    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
+    What warlike noise is this?
+  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
+    To the ambassadors of England gives
+    This warlike volley.
+  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
+    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
+    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
+    But I do prophesy th' election lights  
+    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
+    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
+    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
+  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
+    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
+                                                 [March within.]
+    Why does the drum come hither?
+
+    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
+                  Colours, and Attendants.
+
+  Fort. Where is this sight?
+  Hor. What is it you will see?
+    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
+  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
+    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
+    That thou so many princes at a shot
+    So bloodily hast struck.
+  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
+    And our affairs from England come too late.  
+    The ears are senseless that should give us bearing
+    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
+    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
+    Where should We have our thanks?
+  Hor. Not from his mouth,
+    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
+    He never gave commandment for their death.
+    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
+    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
+    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
+    High on a stage be placed to the view;
+    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
+    How these things came about. So shall You hear
+    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
+    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
+    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
+    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
+    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
+    Truly deliver.
+  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,  
+    And call the noblest to the audience.
+    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
+    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
+    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
+  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
+    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
+    But let this same be presently perform'd,
+    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
+    On plots and errors happen.
+  Fort. Let four captains
+    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
+    For he was likely, had he been put on,
+    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
+    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
+    Speak loudly for him.
+    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
+    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
+    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
+            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
+                                                   are shot off.

+SCENE.- Elsinore.
+
+
+ACT I. Scene I.
+Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.
+
+Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
+at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].
+
+  Ber. Who's there.?
+  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
+  Ber. Long live the King!
+  Fran. Bernardo?
+  Ber. He.
+  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
+  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
+  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
+    And I am sick at heart.
+  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
+  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
+  Ber. Well, good night.
+    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
+    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
+
+                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.  
+
+  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
+  Hor. Friends to this ground.
+  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
+  Fran. Give you good night.
+  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
+    Who hath reliev'd you?
+  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
+    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
+  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
+  Ber. Say-
+    What, is Horatio there ?
+  Hor. A piece of him.
+  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
+  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
+  Ber. I have seen nothing.
+  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
+    And will not let belief take hold of him
+    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
+    Therefore I have entreated him along,  
+    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
+    That, if again this apparition come,
+    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
+  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
+  Ber. Sit down awhile,
+    And let us once again assail your ears,
+    That are so fortified against our story,
+    What we two nights have seen.
+  Hor. Well, sit we down,
+    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
+  Ber. Last night of all,
+    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
+    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
+    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
+    The bell then beating one-
+
+                        Enter Ghost.
+
+  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
+  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  
+  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
+  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
+  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
+  Ber. It would be spoke to.
+  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
+  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
+    Together with that fair and warlike form
+    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
+    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
+  Mar. It is offended.
+  Ber. See, it stalks away!
+  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
+                                                     Exit Ghost.
+  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
+  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
+    Is not this something more than fantasy?
+    What think you on't?
+  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
+    Without the sensible and true avouch
+    Of mine own eyes.  
+  Mar. Is it not like the King?
+  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
+    Such was the very armour he had on
+    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
+    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
+    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
+    'Tis strange.
+  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
+    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
+  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
+    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
+    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
+  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
+    Why this same strict and most observant watch
+    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
+    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
+    And foreign mart for implements of war;
+    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
+    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
+    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
+    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
+    Who is't that can inform me?
+  Hor. That can I.
+    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
+    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
+    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
+    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
+    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
+    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
+    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
+    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
+    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
+    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
+    Against the which a moiety competent
+    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
+    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
+    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
+    And carriage of the article design'd,
+    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
+    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,  
+    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
+    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
+    For food and diet, to some enterprise
+    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
+    As it doth well appear unto our state,
+    But to recover of us, by strong hand
+    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
+    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
+    Is the main motive of our preparations,
+    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
+    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
+  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
+    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
+    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
+    That was and is the question of these wars.
+  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
+    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
+    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
+    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
+    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;  
+    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
+    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
+    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
+    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
+    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
+    As harbingers preceding still the fates
+    And prologue to the omen coming on,
+    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
+    Unto our climature and countrymen.
+
+                      Enter Ghost again.
+
+    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
+    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
+                                               Spreads his arms.
+    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
+    Speak to me.
+    If there be any good thing to be done,
+    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
+    Speak to me.  
+    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
+    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
+    O, speak!
+    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
+    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
+    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
+                                                 The cock crows.
+    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
+  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
+  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
+  Ber. 'Tis here!
+  Hor. 'Tis here!
+  Mar. 'Tis gone!
+                                                     Exit Ghost.
+    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
+    To offer it the show of violence;
+    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
+    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
+  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
+  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  
+    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
+    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
+    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
+    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
+    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
+    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
+    To his confine; and of the truth herein
+    This present object made probation.
+  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
+    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
+    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
+    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
+    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
+    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
+    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
+    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
+  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
+    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
+    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
+    Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
+    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
+    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
+    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
+    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
+    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
+    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
+    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.
+
+
+
+
+Scene II.
+Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.
+
+Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet,
+Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
+Lords Attendant.
+
+  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
+    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
+    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
+    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
+    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
+    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
+    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
+    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
+    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
+    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
+    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
+    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
+    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
+    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
+    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
+    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
+    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
+    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
+    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
+    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
+    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
+    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
+    Importing the surrender of those lands
+    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
+    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
+    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
+    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
+    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
+    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
+    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
+    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
+    The lists, and full proportions are all made
+    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
+    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
+    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
+    Giving to you no further personal power
+    To business with the King, more than the scope
+    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
+    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
+  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
+  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
+                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
+    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
+    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
+    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
+    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
+    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
+    The head is not more native to the heart,
+    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
+    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
+    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
+  Laer. My dread lord,
+    Your leave and favour to return to France;
+    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
+    To show my duty in your coronation,  
+    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
+    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
+    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
+  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
+  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
+    By laboursome petition, and at last
+    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
+    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
+  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
+    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
+    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
+  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
+  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
+  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
+  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
+    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
+    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
+    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
+    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
+    Passing through nature to eternity.  
+  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
+  Queen. If it be,
+    Why seems it so particular with thee?
+  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
+    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
+    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
+    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
+    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
+    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
+    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
+    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
+    For they are actions that a man might play;
+    But I have that within which passeth show-
+    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
+  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
+    To give these mourning duties to your father;
+    But you must know, your father lost a father;
+    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
+    In filial obligation for some term
+    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever  
+    In obstinate condolement is a course
+    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
+    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
+    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
+    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
+    For what we know must be, and is as common
+    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
+    Why should we in our peevish opposition
+    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
+    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
+    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
+    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
+    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
+    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
+    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
+    As of a father; for let the world take note
+    You are the most immediate to our throne,
+    And with no less nobility of love
+    Than that which dearest father bears his son
+    Do I impart toward you. For your intent  
+    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
+    It is most retrograde to our desire;
+    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
+    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
+    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
+  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
+    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
+  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
+  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
+    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
+    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
+    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
+    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
+    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
+    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
+    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
+                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
+  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
+    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
+    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  
+    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
+    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
+    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
+    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
+    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
+    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
+    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
+    So excellent a king, that was to this
+    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
+    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
+    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
+    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
+    As if increase of appetite had grown
+    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
+    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
+    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
+    With which she followed my poor father's body
+    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
+    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
+    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;  
+    My father's brother, but no more like my father
+    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
+    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
+    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
+    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
+    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
+    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
+    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
+
+          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.
+
+  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
+  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
+    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
+  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
+  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
+    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
+    Marcellus?
+  Mar. My good lord!
+  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-  
+    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
+  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
+  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
+    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
+    To make it truster of your own report
+    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
+    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
+    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
+  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
+  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
+    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
+  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
+  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
+    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
+    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
+    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
+    My father- methinks I see my father.
+  Hor. O, where, my lord?
+  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
+  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.  
+  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
+    I shall not look upon his like again.
+  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
+  Ham. Saw? who?
+  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
+  Ham. The King my father?
+  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
+    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
+    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
+    This marvel to you.
+  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
+  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
+    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
+    In the dead vast and middle of the night
+    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
+    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
+    Appears before them and with solemn march
+    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
+    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
+    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd  
+    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
+    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
+    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
+    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
+    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
+    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
+    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
+    These hands are not more like.
+  Ham. But where was this?
+  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
+  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
+  Hor. My lord, I did;
+    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
+    It lifted up it head and did address
+    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
+    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
+    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
+    And vanish'd from our sight.
+  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
+  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  
+    And we did think it writ down in our duty
+    To let you know of it.
+  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
+    Hold you the watch to-night?
+  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
+  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
+  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
+  Ham. From top to toe?
+  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
+  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
+  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
+  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
+  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
+  Ham. Pale or red?
+  Hor. Nay, very pale.
+  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
+  Hor. Most constantly.
+  Ham. I would I had been there.
+  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
+  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  
+  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
+  Both. Longer, longer.
+  Hor. Not when I saw't.
+  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
+  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
+    A sable silver'd.
+  Ham. I will watch to-night.
+    Perchance 'twill walk again.
+  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
+  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
+    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
+    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
+    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
+    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
+    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
+    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
+    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
+    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
+    I'll visit you.
+  All. Our duty to your honour.  
+  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
+                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
+    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
+    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
+    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
+    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
+Exit.
+
+
+
+
+Scene III.
+Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.
+
+Enter Laertes and Ophelia.
+
+  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
+    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
+    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
+    But let me hear from you.
+  Oph. Do you doubt that?
+  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
+    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
+    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
+    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
+    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
+    No more.
+  Oph. No more but so?
+  Laer. Think it no more.
+    For nature crescent does not grow alone
+    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
+    The inward service of the mind and soul
+    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,  
+    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
+    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
+    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
+    For he himself is subject to his birth.
+    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
+    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
+    The safety and health of this whole state,
+    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
+    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
+    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
+    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
+    As he in his particular act and place
+    May give his saying deed; which is no further
+    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
+    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
+    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
+    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
+    To his unmast'red importunity.
+    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
+    And keep you in the rear of your affection,  
+    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
+    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
+    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
+    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
+    The canker galls the infants of the spring
+    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
+    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
+    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
+    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
+    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
+  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
+    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
+    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
+    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
+    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
+    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
+    And recks not his own rede.
+  Laer. O, fear me not!
+
+                       Enter Polonius.  
+
+    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
+    A double blessing is a double grace;
+    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
+  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
+    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
+    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
+    And these few precepts in thy memory
+    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
+    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
+    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
+    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
+    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
+    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
+    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
+    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
+    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
+    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
+    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
+    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
+    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
+    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
+    And they in France of the best rank and station
+    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
+    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
+    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
+    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
+    This above all- to thine own self be true,
+    And it must follow, as the night the day,
+    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
+    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
+  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
+  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
+  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
+    What I have said to you.
+  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
+    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
+  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
+  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
+  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.  
+  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
+    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
+    Given private time to you, and you yourself
+    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
+    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
+    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
+    You do not understand yourself so clearly
+    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
+    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
+  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
+    Of his affection to me.
+  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
+    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
+    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
+  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
+  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
+    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
+    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
+    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
+    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.  
+  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
+    In honourable fashion.
+  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
+  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
+    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
+  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
+    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
+    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
+    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
+    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
+    You must not take for fire. From this time
+    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
+    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
+    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
+    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
+    And with a larger tether may he walk
+    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
+    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
+    Not of that dye which their investments show,
+    But mere implorators of unholy suits,  
+    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
+    The better to beguile. This is for all:
+    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
+    Have you so slander any moment leisure
+    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
+    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
+  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
+                                                         Exeunt.
+
+
+
+
+Scene IV.
+Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.
+
+Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.
+
+  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
+  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
+  Ham. What hour now?
+  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
+  Mar. No, it is struck.
+  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
+    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
+                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
+    What does this mean, my lord?
+  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
+    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
+    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
+    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
+    The triumph of his pledge.
+  Hor. Is it a custom?
+  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
+    But to my mind, though I am native here  
+    And to the manner born, it is a custom
+    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
+    This heavy-headed revel east and west
+    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
+    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
+    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
+    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
+    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
+    So oft it chances in particular men
+    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
+    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
+    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
+    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
+    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
+    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
+    The form of plausive manners, that these men
+    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
+    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
+    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
+    As infinite as man may undergo-  
+    Shall in the general censure take corruption
+    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
+    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.
+
+                         Enter Ghost.
+
+  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
+  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
+    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
+    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
+    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
+    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
+    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
+    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
+    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
+    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
+    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
+    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
+    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
+    To cast thee up again. What may this mean  
+    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
+    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
+    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
+    So horridly to shake our disposition
+    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
+    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
+                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
+  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
+    As if it some impartment did desire
+    To you alone.
+  Mar. Look with what courteous action
+    It waves you to a more removed ground.
+    But do not go with it!
+  Hor. No, by no means!
+  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
+  Hor. Do not, my lord!
+  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
+    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
+    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
+    Being a thing immortal as itself?  
+    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
+  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
+    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
+    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
+    And there assume some other, horrible form
+    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
+    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
+    The very place puts toys of desperation,
+    Without more motive, into every brain
+    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
+    And hears it roar beneath.
+  Ham. It waves me still.
+    Go on. I'll follow thee.
+  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
+  Ham. Hold off your hands!
+  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
+  Ham. My fate cries out
+    And makes each petty artire in this body
+    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
+                                                [Ghost beckons.]  
+    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
+    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
+    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
+                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
+  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
+  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
+  Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?
+  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
+  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
+  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
+                                                         Exeunt.
+
+
+
+
+Scene V.
+Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.
+
+Enter Ghost and Hamlet.
+
+  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
+  Ghost. Mark me.
+  Ham. I will.
+  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
+    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
+    Must render up myself.
+  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
+  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
+    To what I shall unfold.
+  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
+  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
+  Ham. What?
+  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
+    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
+    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
+    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
+    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid  
+    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
+    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
+    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
+    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
+    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
+    And each particular hair to stand an end
+    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
+    But this eternal blazon must not be
+    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
+    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
+  Ham. O God!
+  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
+  Ham. Murther?
+  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
+    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
+  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
+    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
+    May sweep to my revenge.
+  Ghost. I find thee apt;
+    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  
+    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
+    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
+    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
+    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
+    Is by a forged process of my death
+    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
+    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
+    Now wears his crown.
+  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
+    My uncle?
+  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
+    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
+    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
+    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
+    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
+    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
+    From me, whose love was of that dignity
+    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
+    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
+    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  
+    To those of mine!
+    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
+    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
+    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
+    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
+    And prey on garbage.
+    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
+    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
+    My custom always of the afternoon,
+    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
+    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
+    And in the porches of my ears did pour
+    The leperous distilment; whose effect
+    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
+    That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
+    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
+    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
+    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
+    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
+    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,  
+    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
+    All my smooth body.
+    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
+    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
+    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
+    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
+    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
+    With all my imperfections on my head.
+  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
+  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
+    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
+    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
+    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
+    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
+    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
+    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
+    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
+    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
+    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
+    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.  
+  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
+    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
+    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
+    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
+    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
+    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
+    Yea, from the table of my memory
+    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
+    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
+    That youth and observation copied there,
+    And thy commandment all alone shall live
+    Within the book and volume of my brain,
+    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
+    O most pernicious woman!
+    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
+    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
+    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
+    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
+    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
+    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'  
+    I have sworn't.
+  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!
+
+                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
+
+  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
+  Hor. Heaven secure him!
+  Ham. So be it!
+  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
+  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
+  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
+  Hor. What news, my lord?
+  Mar. O, wonderful!
+  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
+  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
+  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
+  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
+  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
+    But you'll be secret?
+  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.  
+  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
+    But he's an arrant knave.
+  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
+    To tell us this.
+  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
+    And so, without more circumstance at all,
+    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
+    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
+    For every man hath business and desire,
+    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
+    Look you, I'll go pray.
+  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
+  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
+    Yes, faith, heartily.
+  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
+  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
+    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
+    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
+    For your desire to know what is between us,
+    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,  
+    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
+    Give me one poor request.
+  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
+  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
+  Both. My lord, we will not.
+  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
+  Hor. In faith,
+    My lord, not I.
+  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
+  Ham. Upon my sword.
+  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
+  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
+
+                 Ghost cries under the stage.
+
+  Ghost. Swear.
+  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
+    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
+    Consent to swear.
+  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.  
+  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
+    Swear by my sword.
+  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
+  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
+    Come hither, gentlemen,
+    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
+    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
+    Swear by my sword.
+  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
+  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
+    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
+  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
+  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
+    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
+    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
+    But come!
+    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
+    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
+    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
+    To put an antic disposition on),  
+    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
+    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
+    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
+    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
+    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
+    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
+    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
+    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
+    Swear.
+  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
+                                                   [They swear.]
+  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
+    With all my love I do commend me to you;
+    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
+    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
+    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
+    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
+    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
+    That ever I was born to set it right!
+    Nay, come, let's go together.  
+                                                         Exeunt.

+
+Act II. Scene I.
+Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.
+
+Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.
+
+  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
+  Rey. I will, my lord.
+  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
+    Before You visit him, to make inquire
+    Of his behaviour.
+  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
+  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
+    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
+    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
+    What company, at what expense; and finding
+    By this encompassment and drift of question
+    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
+    Than your particular demands will touch it.
+    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
+    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
+    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
+  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.  
+  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
+    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
+    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
+    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
+    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
+    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
+    As are companions noted and most known
+    To youth and liberty.
+  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
+  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
+    Drabbing. You may go so far.
+  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
+  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
+    You must not put another scandal on him,
+    That he is open to incontinency.
+    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
+    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
+    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
+    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
+    Of general assault.  
+  Rey. But, my good lord-
+  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
+  Rey. Ay, my lord,
+    I would know that.
+  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
+    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
+    You laying these slight sullies on my son
+    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
+    Mark you,
+    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
+    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
+    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
+    He closes with you in this consequence:
+    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
+    According to the phrase or the addition
+    Of man and country-
+  Rey. Very good, my lord.
+  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
+    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
+  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and  
+    gentleman.'
+  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
+    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
+    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
+    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
+    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
+    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
+    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
+    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
+    See you now-
+    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
+    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
+    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
+    By indirections find directions out.
+    So, by my former lecture and advice,
+    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not
+  Rey. My lord, I have.
+  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
+  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
+  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.  
+  Rey. I shall, my lord.
+  Pol. And let him ply his music.
+  Rey. Well, my lord.
+  Pol. Farewell!
+                                                  Exit Reynaldo.
+
+                       Enter Ophelia.
+
+    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
+  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
+  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I
+  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
+    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
+    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
+    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
+    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
+    And with a look so piteous in purport
+    As if he had been loosed out of hell
+    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
+  Pol. Mad for thy love?  
+  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
+    But truly I do fear it.
+  Pol. What said he?
+  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
+    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
+    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
+    He falls to such perusal of my face
+    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
+    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
+    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
+    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
+    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
+    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
+    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
+    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
+    For out o' doors he went without their help
+    And to the last bended their light on me.
+  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
+    This is the very ecstasy of love,
+    Whose violent property fordoes itself  
+    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
+    As oft as any passion under heaven
+    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
+    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
+  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
+    I did repel his letters and denied
+    His access to me.
+  Pol. That hath made him mad.
+    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
+    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
+    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
+    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
+    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
+    As it is common for the younger sort
+    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
+    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
+    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
+    Come.
+                                                         Exeunt.
+
+Scene II.
+Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
+
+Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, cum aliis.
+
+  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
+    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
+    The need we have to use you did provoke
+    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
+    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
+    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
+    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
+    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
+    So much from th' understanding of himself,
+    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
+    That, being of so young clays brought up with him,
+    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
+    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
+    Some little time; so by your companies
+    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
+    So much as from occasion you may glean,  
+    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
+    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
+  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
+    And sure I am two men there are not living
+    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
+    To show us so much gentry and good will
+    As to expend your time with us awhile
+    For the supply and profit of our hope,
+    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
+    As fits a king's remembrance.
+  Ros. Both your Majesties
+    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
+    Put your dread pleasures more into command
+    Than to entreaty.
+  Guil. But we both obey,
+    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
+    To lay our service freely at your feet,
+    To be commanded.
+  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
+  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.  
+    And I beseech you instantly to visit
+    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
+    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
+  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
+    Pleasant and helpful to him!
+  Queen. Ay, amen!
+                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
+                                                    Attendants].
+
+                         Enter Polonius.
+
+  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
+    Are joyfully return'd.
+  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
+  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
+    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
+    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
+    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
+    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
+    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found  
+    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
+  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
+  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
+    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
+  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
+                                                [Exit Polonius.]
+    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
+    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
+  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
+    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
+  King. Well, we shall sift him.
+
+              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.
+
+    Welcome, my good friends.
+    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
+  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
+    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
+    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
+    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,  
+    But better look'd into, he truly found
+    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
+    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
+    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
+    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
+    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
+    Makes vow before his uncle never more
+    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
+    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
+    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
+    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
+    So levied as before, against the Polack;
+    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
+                                                [Gives a paper.]
+    That it might please you to give quiet pass
+    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
+    On such regards of safety and allowance
+    As therein are set down.
+  King. It likes us well;
+    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,  
+    Answer, and think upon this business.
+    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
+    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
+    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
+  Pol. This business is well ended.
+    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
+    What majesty should be, what duty is,
+    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
+    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
+    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
+    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
+    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
+    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
+    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
+    But let that go.
+  Queen. More matter, with less art.
+  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
+    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
+    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
+    But farewell it, for I will use no art.  
+    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
+    That we find out the cause of this effect-
+    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
+    For this effect defective comes by cause.
+    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
+    Perpend.
+    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
+    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
+    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
+                                             [Reads] the letter.
+    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
+      Ophelia,'-
+
+    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
+      phrase.
+    But you shall hear. Thus:
+                                                        [Reads.]
+    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
+  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
+  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]  
+
+          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
+            Doubt that the sun doth move;
+          Doubt truth to be a liar;
+            But never doubt I love.
+      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to
+    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
+    it. Adieu.
+      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
+                                                          HAMLET.'
+
+    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
+    And more above, hath his solicitings,
+    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
+    All given to mine ear.
+  King. But how hath she
+    Receiv'd his love?
+  Pol. What do you think of me?
+  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
+  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,  
+    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
+    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
+    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
+    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
+    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
+    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
+    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
+    What might you think? No, I went round to work
+    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
+    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
+    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
+    That she should lock herself from his resort,
+    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
+    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
+    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
+    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
+    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
+    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
+    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
+    And all we mourn for.  
+  King. Do you think 'tis this?
+  Queen. it may be, very like.
+  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
+    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
+    When it prov'd otherwise.?
+  King. Not that I know.
+  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this
+      be otherwise.
+    If circumstances lead me, I will find
+    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
+    Within the centre.
+  King. How may we try it further?
+  Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together
+    Here in the lobby.
+  Queen. So he does indeed.
+  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
+    Be you and I behind an arras then.
+    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
+    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
+    Let me be no assistant for a state,  
+    But keep a farm and carters.
+  King. We will try it.
+
+                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.
+
+  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
+  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
+    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
+                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
+    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
+  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
+  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
+  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
+  Pol. Not I, my lord.
+  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
+  Pol. Honest, my lord?
+  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
+    pick'd out of ten thousand.
+  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
+  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god  
+    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
+  Pol. I have, my lord.
+  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
+    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
+  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet
+    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is far
+    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity
+    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you
+    read, my lord?
+  Ham. Words, words, words.
+  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
+  Ham. Between who?
+  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
+  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
+    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
+    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
+    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,
+    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
+    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
+    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.  
+  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.-
+   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
+  Ham. Into my grave?
+  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes
+    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
+    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
+    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
+    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
+    my leave of you.
+  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
+    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my
+    life,
+
+                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
+
+  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
+  Ham. These tedious old fools!
+  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
+  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
+                                                Exit [Polonius].  
+  Guil. My honour'd lord!
+  Ros. My most dear lord!
+  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
+    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
+  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
+  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
+    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
+  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
+  Ros. Neither, my lord.
+  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
+    favours?
+  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
+  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
+    strumpet. What news ?
+  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
+  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
+    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
+    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
+    hither?
+  Guil. Prison, my lord?  
+  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
+  Ros. Then is the world one.
+  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
+    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
+  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
+  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
+    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
+  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your
+    mind.
+  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
+    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
+  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
+    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
+  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
+  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
+    it is but a shadow's shadow.
+  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
+    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my
+    fay, I cannot reason.
+  Both. We'll wait upon you.  
+  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
+    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
+    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what
+    make you at Elsinore?
+  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
+  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
+    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
+    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
+    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak.
+  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
+  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
+    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
+    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen
+    have sent for you.
+  Ros. To what end, my lord?
+  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
+    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
+    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
+    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
+    me, whether you were sent for or no.  
+  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
+  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
+    not off.
+  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
+  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
+    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
+    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my
+    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
+    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
+    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
+    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
+    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing
+    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
+    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
+    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
+    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
+    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what
+    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman
+    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
+  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.  
+  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
+  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
+    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them
+    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
+  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
+    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
+    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
+    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
+    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
+    freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are
+    they?
+  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
+    tragedians of the city.
+  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
+    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
+  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
+    innovation.
+  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
+    city? Are they so follow'd?
+  Ros. No indeed are they not.  
+  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
+  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
+    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
+    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now
+    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
+    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
+    dare scarce come thither.
+  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
+    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
+    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
+    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means
+    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
+    against their own succession.
+  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
+    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a
+    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
+    went to cuffs in the question.
+  Ham. Is't possible?
+  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
+  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?  
+  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
+  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
+    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
+    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
+    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
+    philosophy could find it out.
+
+                     Flourish for the Players.
+
+  Guil. There are the players.
+  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
+    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
+    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
+    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
+    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father
+    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
+  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
+  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
+    know a hawk from a handsaw.
+  
+                            Enter Polonius.
+
+  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
+  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
+    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
+    clouts.
+  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
+    man is twice a child.
+  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
+   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
+  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
+  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
+    Rome-
+  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
+  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
+  Pol. Upon my honour-
+  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
+  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
+    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
+    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene  
+    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
+    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
+    the only men.
+  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
+  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
+  Ham. Why,
+
+         'One fair daughter, and no more,
+           The which he loved passing well.'
+
+  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
+  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
+  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
+    love passing well.
+  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
+  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
+  Ham. Why,
+
+           'As by lot, God wot,'
+
+ and then, you know,
+  
+           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'
+
+    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
+    where my abridgment comes.
+
+                     Enter four or five Players.
+
+    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee
+    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy face is
+    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
+    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
+    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
+    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
+    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are
+    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
+    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a
+    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
+  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
+  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
+    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd  
+    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I
+    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
+    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
+    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
+    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
+    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
+    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
+    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in't
+    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
+    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in
+    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:
+
+         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'
+
+    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:
+
+         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
+         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
+         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
+         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd  
+         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
+         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
+         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
+         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
+         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
+         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
+         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
+         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
+         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
+
+    So, proceed you.
+  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
+     discretion.
+
+  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
+      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
+      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
+      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
+      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
+      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword  
+      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
+      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
+      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
+      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
+      Which was declining on the milky head
+      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
+      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
+      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
+      Did nothing.
+      But, as we often see, against some storm,
+      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
+      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
+      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
+      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
+      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
+      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
+      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
+      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
+      Now falls on Priam.
+      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,  
+      In general synod take away her power;
+      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
+      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
+      As low as to the fiends!
+
+  Pol. This is too long.
+  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
+    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
+    Hecuba.
+
+  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'
+
+  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
+  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
+
+  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
+      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
+      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
+      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
+      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  
+      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
+      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
+      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
+      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
+      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
+      The instant burst of clamour that she made
+      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
+      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
+      And passion in the gods.'
+
+  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
+    eyes. Prithee no more!
+  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
+    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
+    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief
+    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a
+    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
+  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
+  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
+    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own  
+    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in
+    your bounty. Take them in.
+  Pol. Come, sirs.
+  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
+                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
+    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
+    Gonzago'?
+  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
+  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
+    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and
+    insert in't, could you not?
+  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
+  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
+                                            [Exit First Player.]
+    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to
+    Elsinore.
+  Ros. Good my lord!
+  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
+                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
+    Now I am alone.  
+    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
+    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
+    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
+    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
+    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
+    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
+    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
+    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
+    For Hecuba!
+    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
+    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
+    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
+    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
+    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
+    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
+    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
+    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
+    Yet I,
+    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
+    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,  
+    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
+    Upon whose property and most dear life
+    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
+    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
+    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
+    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
+    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
+    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
+    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
+    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
+    I should have fatted all the region kites
+    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
+    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
+    O, vengeance!
+    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
+    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
+    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
+    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
+    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
+    A scullion!  
+    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
+    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
+    Have by the very cunning of the scene
+    Been struck so to the soul that presently
+    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
+    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
+    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
+    Play something like the murther of my father
+    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
+    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
+    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
+    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
+    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
+    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
+    As he is very potent with such spirits,
+    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
+    More relative than this. The play's the thing
+    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

+
+ACT III. Scene I.
+Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
+
+Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Lords.
+
+  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
+    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
+    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
+    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
+  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
+    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
+  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
+    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
+    When we would bring him on to some confession
+    Of his true state.
+  Queen. Did he receive you well?
+  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
+  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
+  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
+    Most free in his reply.
+  Queen. Did you assay him  
+    To any pastime?
+  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
+    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
+    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
+    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
+    And, as I think, they have already order
+    This night to play before him.
+  Pol. 'Tis most true;
+    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
+    To hear and see the matter.
+  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
+    To hear him so inclin'd.
+    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
+    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
+  Ros. We shall, my lord.
+                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
+  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
+    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
+    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
+    Affront Ophelia.  
+    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
+    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
+    We may of their encounter frankly judge
+    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
+    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
+    That thus he suffers for.
+  Queen. I shall obey you;
+    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
+    That your good beauties be the happy cause
+    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
+    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
+    To both your honours.
+  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
+                                                   [Exit Queen.]
+  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
+    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
+    That show of such an exercise may colour
+    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
+    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
+    And pious action we do sugar o'er  
+    The Devil himself.
+  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
+    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
+    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
+    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
+    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
+    O heavy burthen!
+  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
+                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].
+
+                           Enter Hamlet.
+
+  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
+    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
+    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
+    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
+    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
+    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
+    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
+    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation  
+    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
+    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
+    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
+    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
+    Must give us pause. There's the respect
+    That makes calamity of so long life.
+    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
+    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
+    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
+    The insolence of office, and the spurns
+    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
+    When he himself might his quietus make
+    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
+    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
+    But that the dread of something after death-
+    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
+    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
+    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
+    Than fly to others that we know not of?
+    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  
+    And thus the native hue of resolution
+    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
+    And enterprises of great pith and moment
+    With this regard their currents turn awry
+    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
+    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
+    Be all my sins rememb'red.
+  Oph. Good my lord,
+    How does your honour for this many a day?
+  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
+  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
+    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
+    I pray you, now receive them.
+  Ham. No, not I!
+    I never gave you aught.
+  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
+    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
+    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
+    Take these again; for to the noble mind
+    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.  
+    There, my lord.
+  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
+  Oph. My lord?
+  Ham. Are you fair?
+  Oph. What means your lordship?
+  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
+    discourse to your beauty.
+  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
+  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
+    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
+    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,
+    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
+  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
+  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
+    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
+    not.
+  Oph. I was the more deceived.
+  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
+    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse
+    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.  
+    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
+    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
+    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
+    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all;
+    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
+    father?
+  Oph. At home, my lord.
+  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
+    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
+  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
+  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
+    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
+    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
+    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
+    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
+    Farewell.
+  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
+  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
+    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you
+    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make your  
+    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made
+    me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages. Those that are
+    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as
+    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
+  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
+    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
+    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
+    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
+    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
+    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
+    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
+    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
+    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
+    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
+    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
+    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
+
+                   Enter King and Polonius.
+
+  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;  
+    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
+    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
+    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
+    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
+    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
+    I have in quick determination
+    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
+    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
+    Haply the seas, and countries different,
+    With variable objects, shall expel
+    This something-settled matter in his heart,
+    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
+    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
+  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
+    The origin and commencement of his grief
+    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
+    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
+    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
+    But if you hold it fit, after the play
+    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him  
+    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
+    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
+    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
+    To England send him; or confine him where
+    Your wisdom best shall think.
+  King. It shall be so.
+    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.

+Scene II.
+Elsinore. hall in the Castle.
+
+Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.
+
+  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
+    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
+    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
+    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
+    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
+    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
+    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
+    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
+    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who
+    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
+    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
+    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
+  Player. I warrant your honour.
+  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
+    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
+    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
+    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,  
+    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
+    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature,
+    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
+    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though
+    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
+    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
+    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
+    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to
+    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
+    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
+    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
+    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
+    humanity so abominably.
+  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
+  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
+    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
+    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
+    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary
+    question of the play be then to be considered. That's villanous
+    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go  
+    make you ready.
+                                                 Exeunt Players.
+
+            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.
+
+    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
+  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
+  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
+    help to hasten them?
+  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
+  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!
+
+                      Enter Horatio.
+
+  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
+  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
+    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
+  Hor. O, my dear lord!
+  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
+    For what advancement may I hope from thee,  
+    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
+    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
+    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
+    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
+    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
+    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
+    And could of men distinguish, her election
+    Hath scald thee for herself. For thou hast been
+    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
+    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
+    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
+    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
+    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
+    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
+    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
+    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
+    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
+    There is a play to-night before the King.
+    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
+    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.  
+    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
+    Even with the very comment of thy soul
+    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
+    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
+    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
+    And my imaginations are as foul
+    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
+    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
+    And after we will both our judgments join
+    In censure of his seeming.
+  Hor. Well, my lord.
+    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
+    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
+
+    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
+    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
+      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
+                       carrying torches.
+
+  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.  
+    Get you a place.
+  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
+  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
+    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
+  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not
+    mine.
+  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
+    i' th' university, you say?
+  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
+  Ham. What did you enact?
+  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol; Brutus
+    kill'd me.
+  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
+    the players ready.
+  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
+  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
+  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
+  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
+  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
+                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]  
+  Oph. No, my lord.
+  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
+  Oph. Ay, my lord.
+  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
+  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
+  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
+  Oph. What is, my lord?
+  Ham. Nothing.
+  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
+  Ham. Who, I?
+  Oph. Ay, my lord.
+  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
+    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
+    within 's two hours.
+  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
+  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
+    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten
+    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
+    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or else
+    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose  
+    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'
+
+               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.
+
+    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
+    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
+    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
+    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
+    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
+    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
+    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
+    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes,
+    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
+    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
+    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
+    his love.
+                                                         Exeunt.
+
+  Oph. What means this, my lord?
+  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.  
+  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
+
+                      Enter Prologue.
+
+  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
+    they'll tell all.
+  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
+  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
+    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
+  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.
+
+    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
+      Here stooping to your clemency,
+      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]
+
+  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
+  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
+  Ham. As woman's love.
+
+              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.  
+
+    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
+      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
+      And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
+      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
+      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
+      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
+    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
+      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
+      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
+      So far from cheer and from your former state.
+      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
+      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
+      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
+      In neither aught, or in extremity.
+      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
+      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
+      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
+      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
+    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;  
+      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
+      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
+      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
+      For husband shalt thou-
+    Queen. O, confound the rest!
+      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
+      When second husband let me be accurst!
+      None wed the second but who killed the first.
+
+  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
+
+    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
+      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
+      A second time I kill my husband dead
+      When second husband kisses me in bed.
+    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
+      But what we do determine oft we break.
+      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
+      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
+      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,  
+      But fill unshaken when they mellow be.
+      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
+      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
+      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
+      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
+      The violence of either grief or joy
+      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
+      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
+      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
+      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
+      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
+      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
+      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
+      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
+      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
+      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
+      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
+      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
+      Directly seasons him his enemy.
+      But, orderly to end where I begun,  
+      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
+      That our devices still are overthrown;
+      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
+      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
+      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
+    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
+      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
+      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
+      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
+      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
+      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
+      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
+      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
+
+  Ham. If she should break it now!
+
+    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
+      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
+      The tedious day with sleep.
+    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,  
+                                                    [He] sleeps.
+      And never come mischance between us twain!
+Exit.
+
+  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
+  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
+  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
+  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
+  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
+    world.
+  King. What do you call the play?
+  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
+    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's name;
+    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece of
+    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
+    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our withers
+    are unwrung.
+
+                         Enter Lucianus.
+  
+    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
+  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
+  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
+    the puppets dallying.
+  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
+  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
+  Oph. Still better, and worse.
+  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
+    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
+    bellow for revenge.
+
+    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
+      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
+      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
+      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
+      Thy natural magic and dire property
+      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
+                                   Pours the poison in his ears.
+
+  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.  
+    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
+    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
+  Oph. The King rises.
+  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
+  Queen. How fares my lord?
+  Pol. Give o'er the play.
+  King. Give me some light! Away!
+  All. Lights, lights, lights!
+                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
+  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
+          The hart ungalled play;
+         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
+          Thus runs the world away.
+    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of my
+    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my raz'd
+    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
+  Hor. Half a share.
+  Ham.   A whole one I!
+         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
+           This realm dismantled was  
+         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
+           A very, very- pajock.
+  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
+  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
+    pound! Didst perceive?
+  Hor. Very well, my lord.
+  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
+  Hor. I did very well note him.
+  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
+         For if the King like not the comedy,
+         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
+    Come, some music!
+
+                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
+
+  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
+  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
+  Guil. The King, sir-
+  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
+  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.  
+  Ham. With drink, sir?
+  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
+  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
+    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
+    plunge him into far more choler.
+  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
+    not so wildly from my affair.
+  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
+  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit
+    hath sent me to you.
+  Ham. You are welcome.
+  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
+    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
+    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
+    shall be the end of my business.
+  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
+  Guil. What, my lord?
+  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
+    answer is I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
+    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother, you  
+    say-
+  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
+    amazement and admiration.
+  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
+    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
+  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
+  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
+    further trade with us?
+  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
+  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
+  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely
+    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to
+    your friend.
+  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
+  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself
+    for your succession in Denmark?
+  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
+    musty.
+
+                     Enter the Players with recorders.  
+
+    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do
+    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me
+    into a toil?
+  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
+  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
+  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
+  Ham. I pray you.
+  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
+  Ham. I do beseech you.
+  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
+  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
+    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will
+    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
+  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
+    have not the skill.
+  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
+    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
+    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
+    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,  
+    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
+    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than a
+    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
+    you cannot play upon me.
+
+                        Enter Polonius.
+
+    God bless you, sir!
+  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
+  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
+  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
+  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
+  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
+  Ham. Or like a whale.
+  Pol. Very like a whale.
+  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the
+    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
+  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
+  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
+                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]  
+    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
+    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
+    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
+    And do such bitter business as the day
+    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
+    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
+    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
+    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
+    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
+    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
+    How in my words somever she be shent,
+    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.
+
+
+
+
+Scene III.
+A room in the Castle.
+
+Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.
+
+  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
+    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
+    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
+    And he to England shall along with you.
+    The terms of our estate may not endure
+    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
+    Out of his lunacies.
+  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
+    Most holy and religious fear it is
+    To keep those many many bodies safe
+    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
+  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
+    With all the strength and armour of the mind
+    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
+    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
+    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
+    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw  
+    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
+    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
+    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
+    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
+    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
+    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
+    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
+  King. Arm you, I pray you, to th', speedy voyage;
+    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
+    Which now goes too free-footed.
+  Both. We will haste us.
+                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.
+
+                   Enter Polonius.
+
+  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
+    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
+    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
+    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
+    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,  
+    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
+    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
+    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
+    And tell you what I know.
+  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
+                                                Exit [Polonius].
+    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
+    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
+    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
+    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
+    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
+    And, like a man to double business bound,
+    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
+    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
+    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
+    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
+    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
+    But to confront the visage of offence?
+    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
+    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,  
+    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
+    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
+    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
+    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
+    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
+    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
+    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
+    In the corrupted currents of this world
+    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
+    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
+    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
+    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
+    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
+    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
+    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
+    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
+    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
+    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
+    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
+    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.  
+    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
+    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
+    All may be well.                                  He kneels.
+
+                         Enter Hamlet.
+
+  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
+    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
+    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
+    A villain kills my father; and for that,
+    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
+    To heaven.
+    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
+    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
+    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
+    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
+    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
+    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
+    To take him in the purging of his soul,
+    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?  
+    No.
+    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
+    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
+    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
+    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
+    That has no relish of salvation in't-
+    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
+    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
+    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
+    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
+  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
+    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.
+
+
+
+
+Scene IV.
+The Queen's closet.
+
+Enter Queen and Polonius.
+
+  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
+    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
+    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
+    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
+    Pray you be round with him.
+  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
+  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him coming.
+                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]
+
+                          Enter Hamlet.
+
+  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
+  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
+  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
+  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
+  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
+  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?  
+  Ham. What's the matter now?
+  Queen. Have you forgot me?
+  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
+    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
+    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
+  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
+  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge I
+    You go not till I set you up a glass
+    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
+  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
+    Help, help, ho!
+  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
+  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
+            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
+  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
+  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
+  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
+  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
+  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
+    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.  
+  Queen. As kill a king?
+  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
+                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
+    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
+    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
+    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
+    Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! sit you down
+    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
+    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
+    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
+    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
+  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
+    In noise so rude against me?
+  Ham. Such an act
+    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
+    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
+    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
+    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
+    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
+    As from the body of contraction plucks  
+    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
+    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
+    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
+    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
+    Is thought-sick at the act.
+  Queen. Ay me, what act,
+    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
+  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
+    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
+    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
+    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
+    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
+    A station like the herald Mercury
+    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
+    A combination and a form indeed
+    Where every god did seem to set his seal
+    To give the world assurance of a man.
+    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
+    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
+    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?  
+    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
+    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
+    You cannot call it love; for at your age
+    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
+    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
+    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
+    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
+    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
+    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
+    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
+    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
+    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
+    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
+    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
+    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
+    Could not so mope.
+    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
+    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
+    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
+    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame  
+    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
+    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
+    And reason panders will.
+  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
+    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
+    And there I see such black and grained spots
+    As will not leave their tinct.
+  Ham. Nay, but to live
+    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
+    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
+    Over the nasty sty!
+  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
+    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
+    No more, sweet Hamlet!
+  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
+    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
+    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
+    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
+    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
+    And put it in his pocket!  
+  Queen. No more!
+
+                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.
+
+  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
+    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
+    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
+  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
+  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
+    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
+    Th' important acting of your dread command?
+    O, say!
+  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
+    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
+    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
+    O, step between her and her fighting soul
+    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
+    Speak to her, Hamlet.
+  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
+  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,  
+    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
+    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
+    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
+    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
+    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
+    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
+    Upon the beat and flame of thy distemper
+    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
+  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
+    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
+    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
+    Lest with this piteous action you convert
+    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
+    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
+  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
+  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
+  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
+  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
+  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
+  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!  
+    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
+    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
+                                                     Exit Ghost.
+  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
+    This bodiless creation ecstasy
+    Is very cunning in.
+  Ham. Ecstasy?
+    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
+    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
+    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
+    And I the matter will reword; which madness
+    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
+    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
+    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
+    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
+    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
+    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
+    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
+    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
+    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;  
+    For in the fatness of these pursy times
+    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
+    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
+  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
+  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
+    And live the purer with the other half,
+    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
+    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
+    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
+    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
+    That to the use of actions fair and good
+    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
+    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
+    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
+    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
+    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
+    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
+    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
+    And when you are desirous to be blest,
+    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,  
+    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
+    To punish me with this, and this with me,
+    That I must be their scourge and minister.
+    I will bestow him, and will answer well
+    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
+    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
+    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
+    One word more, good lady.
+  Queen. What shall I do?
+  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
+    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
+    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
+    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
+    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
+    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
+    That I essentially am not in madness,
+    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
+    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
+    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
+    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?  
+    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
+    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
+    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
+    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
+    And break your own neck down.
+  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
+    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
+    What thou hast said to me.
+  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
+  Queen. Alack,
+    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
+  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
+    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
+    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
+    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
+    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
+    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
+    But I will delve one yard below their mines
+    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
+    When in one line two crafts directly meet.  
+    This man shall set me packing.
+    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
+    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
+    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
+    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
+    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
+    Good night, mother.
+                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
+                                                       Polonius.

+ACT IV. Scene I.
+Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
+
+Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
+
+  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
+    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
+    Where is your son?
+  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
+                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
+    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
+  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
+  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
+    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
+    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
+    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
+    And in this brainish apprehension kills
+    The unseen good old man.
+  King. O heavy deed!
+    It had been so with us, had we been there.
+    His liberty is full of threats to all-
+    To you yourself, to us, to every one.  
+    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
+    It will be laid to us, whose providence
+    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
+    This mad young man. But so much was our love
+    We would not understand what was most fit,
+    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
+    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
+    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
+  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
+    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
+    Among a mineral of metals base,
+    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
+  King. O Gertrude, come away!
+    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
+    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
+    We must with all our majesty and skill
+    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
+
+             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
+  
+    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
+    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
+    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
+    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
+    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
+                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
+    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
+    And let them know both what we mean to do
+    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
+    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
+    As level as the cannon to his blank,
+    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
+    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
+    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
+                                                         Exeunt.
+
+
+
+
+Scene II.
+Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.
+
+Enter Hamlet.
+
+  Ham. Safely stow'd.
+  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
+  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
+
+               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
+
+  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
+  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
+  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
+    And bear it to the chapel.
+  Ham. Do not believe it.
+  Ros. Believe what?
+  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
+    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son
+    of a king?
+  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
+  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,  
+    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in
+    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;
+    first mouth'd, to be last Swallowed. When he needs what you have
+    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry
+    again.
+  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
+  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
+  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
+    the King.
+  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
+    The King is a thing-
+  Guil. A thing, my lord?
+  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
+                                                         Exeunt.
+
+
+
+
+Scene III.
+Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
+
+Enter King.
+
+  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
+    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
+    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
+    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
+    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
+    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
+    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
+    This sudden sending him away must seem
+    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
+    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
+    Or not at all.
+
+                    Enter Rosencrantz.
+
+    How now O What hath befall'n?
+  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
+    We cannot get from him.  
+  King. But where is he?
+  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
+  King. Bring him before us.
+  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
+
+        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].
+
+  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
+  Ham. At supper.
+  King. At supper? Where?
+  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
+    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your
+    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and
+    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar
+    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's the
+    end.
+  King. Alas, alas!
+  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
+    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
+  King. What dost thou mean by this?  
+  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
+    the guts of a beggar.
+  King. Where is Polonius?
+  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
+    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if you
+    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up
+    the stair, into the lobby.
+  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
+  Ham. He will stay till you come.
+                                            [Exeunt Attendants.]
+  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
+    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
+    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
+    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
+    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
+    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
+    For England.
+  Ham. For England?
+  King. Ay, Hamlet.
+  Ham. Good.  
+  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
+  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
+    Farewell, dear mother.
+  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
+  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
+    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
+Exit.
+  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
+    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
+    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
+    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
+                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
+    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
+    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
+    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
+    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
+    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
+    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
+    By letters congruing to that effect,
+    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;  
+    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
+    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
+    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.
+
+
+
+
+
+Scene IV.
+Near Elsinore.
+
+Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.
+
+  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
+    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
+    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
+    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
+    if that his Majesty would aught with us,
+    We shall express our duty in his eye;
+    And let him know so.
+  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
+  For. Go softly on.
+                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain].
+
+       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.
+
+  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
+  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
+  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
+  Capt. Against some part of Poland.  
+  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
+  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
+  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
+    Or for some frontier?
+  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
+    We go to gain a little patch of ground
+    That hath in it no profit but the name.
+    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
+    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
+    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
+  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
+  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
+  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
+    Will not debate the question of this straw.
+    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
+    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
+    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
+  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
+  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
+  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.  
+                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
+    How all occasions do inform against me
+    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
+    If his chief good and market of his time
+    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
+    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
+    Looking before and after, gave us not
+    That capability and godlike reason
+    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
+    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
+    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
+    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
+    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
+    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
+    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
+    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
+    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
+    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
+    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
+    Makes mouths at the invisible event,  
+    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
+    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
+    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
+    Is not to stir without great argument,
+    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
+    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
+    That have a father klll'd, a mother stain'd,
+    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
+    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
+    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
+    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
+    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
+    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
+    Which is not tomb enough and continent
+    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
+    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.
+
+
+
+
+
+Scene V.
+Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
+
+Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.
+
+  Queen. I will not speak with her.
+  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
+    Her mood will needs be pitied.
+  Queen. What would she have?
+  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
+    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
+    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
+    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
+    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
+    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
+    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
+    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
+    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
+    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
+  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
+    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
+  Queen. Let her come in.  
+                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
+    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
+    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
+    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
+    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
+
+                 Enter Ophelia distracted.
+
+  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
+  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
+  Oph. (sings)
+         How should I your true-love know
+           From another one?
+         By his cockle bat and' staff
+           And his sandal shoon.
+
+  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
+  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.
+
+    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,  
+              He is dead and gone;
+            At his head a grass-green turf,
+              At his heels a stone.
+
+    O, ho!
+  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
+  Oph. Pray you mark.
+
+    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-
+
+                    Enter King.
+
+  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
+  Oph. (Sings)
+           Larded all with sweet flowers;
+         Which bewept to the grave did not go
+           With true-love showers.
+
+  King. How do you, pretty lady?
+  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.  
+    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
+    your table!
+  King. Conceit upon her father.
+  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what
+    it means, say you this:
+
+    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
+              All in the morning bedtime,
+            And I a maid at your window,
+              To be your Valentine.
+
+            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
+              And dupp'd the chamber door,
+            Let in the maid, that out a maid
+              Never departed more.
+
+  King. Pretty Ophelia!
+  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!
+
+    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,  
+              Alack, and fie for shame!
+            Young men will do't if they come to't
+              By Cock, they are to blame.
+
+            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
+              You promis'd me to wed.'
+
+    He answers:
+
+            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
+              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'
+
+  King. How long hath she been thus?
+  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
+    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground.
+    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
+    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night, sweet
+    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
+  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
+                                                 [Exit Horatio.]  
+    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
+    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
+    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
+    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
+    Next, Your son gone, and he most violent author
+    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
+    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
+    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
+    In hugger-mugger to inter him; Poor Ophelia
+    Divided from herself and her fair-judgment,
+    Without the which we are Pictures or mere beasts;
+    Last, and as such containing as all these,
+    Her brother is in secret come from France;
+    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
+    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
+    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
+    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
+    Will nothing stick Our person to arraign
+    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
+    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places  
+    Give, me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
+  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
+  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
+
+                     Enter a Messenger.
+
+    What is the matter?
+  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
+    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
+    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
+    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
+    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
+    And, as the world were now but to begin,
+    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
+    The ratifiers and props of every word,
+    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
+    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
+    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
+                                                 A noise within.
+  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!  
+    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
+  King. The doors are broke.
+
+                    Enter Laertes with others.
+
+  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
+  All. No, let's come in!
+  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
+  All. We will, we will!
+  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
+    O thou vile king,
+    Give me my father!
+  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
+  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
+    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
+    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
+    Of my true mother.
+  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
+    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
+    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.  
+    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
+    That treason can but peep to what it would,
+    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
+    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
+    Speak, man.
+  Laer. Where is my father?
+  King. Dead.
+  Queen. But not by him!
+  King. Let him demand his fill.
+  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
+    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
+    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
+    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
+    That both the world, I give to negligence,
+    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
+    Most throughly for my father.
+  King. Who shall stay you?
+  Laer. My will, not all the world!
+    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
+    They shall go far with little.  
+  King. Good Laertes,
+    If you desire to know the certainty
+    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in Your revenge
+    That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe,
+    Winner and loser?
+  Laer. None but his enemies.
+  King. Will you know them then?
+  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
+    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
+    Repast them with my blood.
+  King. Why, now You speak
+    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
+    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
+    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
+    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
+    As day does to your eye.
+                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
+  Laer. How now? What noise is that?
+
+                      Enter Ophelia.  
+
+    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
+    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
+    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
+    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
+    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
+    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
+    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
+    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
+    It sends some precious instance of itself
+    After the thing it loves.
+
+  Oph. (sings)
+         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
+           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
+         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.
+
+    Fare you well, my dove!
+  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
+    It could not move thus.  
+  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,
+    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his
+    master's daughter.
+  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
+  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
+    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
+  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
+  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
+    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays.
+    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I
+    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my father
+    died. They say he made a good end.
+
+    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
+
+  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
+    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
+  Oph. (sings)
+         And will he not come again?
+         And will he not come again?
+           No, no, he is dead;  
+           Go to thy deathbed;
+         He never will come again.
+
+         His beard was as white as snow,
+         All flaxen was his poll.
+           He is gone, he is gone,
+           And we cast away moan.
+         God 'a'mercy on his soul!
+
+    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi', you.
+Exit.
+  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
+  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
+    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
+    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
+    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
+    If by direct or by collateral hand
+    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
+    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
+    To you in satisfaction; but if not,  
+    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
+    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
+    To give it due content.
+  Laer. Let this be so.
+    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
+    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
+    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
+    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
+    That I must call't in question.
+  King. So you shall;
+    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
+    I pray you go with me.
+                                                          Exeunt

+Scene VI.
+Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.
+
+Enter Horatio with an Attendant.
+
+  Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
+  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for you.
+  Hor. Let them come in.
+                                               [Exit Attendant.]
+    I do not know from what part of the world
+    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
+
+                          Enter Sailors.
+
+  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
+  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
+  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
+    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for England- if
+    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
+  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd
+    this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have
+    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of  
+    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
+    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I
+    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
+    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves
+    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for
+    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou
+    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words
+    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
+    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring
+    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course
+    for England. Of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
+                            'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
+
+    Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
+    And do't the speedier that you may direct me
+    To him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.
+
+
+
+
+
+Scene VII.
+Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.
+
+Enter King and Laertes.
+
+  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
+    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
+    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
+    That he which hath your noble father slain
+    Pursued my life.
+  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
+    Why you proceeded not against these feats
+    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
+    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
+    You mainly were stirr'd up.
+  King. O, for two special reasons,
+    Which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinew'd,
+    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
+    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
+    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
+    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
+    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,  
+    I could not but by her. The other motive
+    Why to a public count I might not go
+    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
+    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
+    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
+    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
+    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
+    Would have reverted to my bow again,
+    And not where I had aim'd them.
+  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
+    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
+    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
+    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
+    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
+  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
+    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
+    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
+    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
+    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
+    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-  
+
+                 Enter a Messenger with letters.
+
+    How now? What news?
+  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
+    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
+  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
+  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
+    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
+    Of him that brought them.
+  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
+    Leave us.
+                                                 Exit Messenger.
+    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on your
+    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
+    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
+    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
+                                                     'HAMLET.'
+    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
+    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?  
+  Laer. Know you the hand?
+  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
+    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
+    Can you advise me?
+  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
+    It warms the very sickness in my heart
+    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
+    'Thus didest thou.'
+  King. If it be so, Laertes
+    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
+    Will you be rul'd by me?
+  Laer. Ay my lord,
+    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
+  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
+    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
+    No more to undertake it, I will work him
+    To exploit now ripe in my device,
+    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
+    And for his death no wind
+    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice  
+    And call it accident.
+  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
+    The rather, if you could devise it so
+    That I might be the organ.
+  King. It falls right.
+    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
+    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
+    Wherein they say you shine, Your sun of parts
+    Did not together pluck such envy from him
+    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
+    Of the unworthiest siege.
+  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
+  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
+    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
+    The light and careless livery that it wears
+    Thin settled age his sables and his weeds,
+    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
+    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
+    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
+    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant  
+    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
+    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
+    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
+    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
+    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
+    Come short of what he did.
+  Laer. A Norman was't?
+  King. A Norman.
+  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
+  King. The very same.
+  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
+    And gem of all the nation.
+  King. He made confession of you;
+    And gave you such a masterly report
+    For art and exercise in your defence,
+    And for your rapier most especially,
+    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
+    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
+    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
+    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his  
+    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
+    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
+    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
+    Now, out of this-
+  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
+  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
+    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
+    A face without a heart,'
+  Laer. Why ask you this?
+  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
+    But that I know love is begun by time,
+    And that I see, in passages of proof,
+    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
+    There lives within the very flame of love
+    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
+    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
+    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
+    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
+    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
+    And hath abatements and delays as many  
+    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
+    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
+    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
+    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
+    To show yourself your father's son in deed
+    More than in words?
+  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
+  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
+    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
+    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
+    Will return'd shall know you are come home.
+    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
+    And set a double varnish on the fame
+    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
+    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
+    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
+    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
+    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
+    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
+    Requite him for your father.  
+  Laer. I will do't!
+    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
+    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
+    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
+    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
+    Collected from all simples that have virtue
+    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
+    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
+    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
+    It may be death.
+  King. Let's further think of this,
+    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
+    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
+    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
+    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
+    Should have a back or second, that might hold
+    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
+    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
+    I ha't!
+    When in your motion you are hot and dry-  
+    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
+    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
+    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
+    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
+    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,
+
+                           Enter Queen.
+
+    How now, sweet queen?
+  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
+    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
+  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
+  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
+    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
+    There with fantastic garlands did she come
+    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
+    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
+    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
+    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
+    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,  
+    When down her weedy trophies and herself
+    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
+    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
+    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
+    As one incapable of her own distress,
+    Or like a creature native and indued
+    Unto that element; but long it could not be
+    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
+    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
+    To muddy death.
+  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
+  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
+  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
+    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
+    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
+    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
+    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
+    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
+    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
+  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.  
+    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
+    Now fear I this will give it start again;
+    Therefore let's follow.
+                                                         Exeunt.

+
+ACT V. Scene I.
+Elsinore. A churchyard.
+
+Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].
+
+  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
+    seeks her own salvation?
+  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
+    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
+  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
+    defence?
+  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
+  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies
+    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and an
+    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
+    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
+  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
+  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the
+    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
+    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water come to
+    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not
+    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.  
+  Other. But is this law?
+  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
+  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
+    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.
+  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great folk
+    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang themselves
+    more than their even-Christen. Come, my spade! There is no
+    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They
+    hold up Adam's profession.
+  Other. Was he a gentleman?
+  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
+  Other. Why, he had none.
+  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
+    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll
+    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
+    purpose, confess thyself-
+  Other. Go to!
+  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
+    shipwright, or the carpenter?
+  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand  
+    tenants.
+  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well.
+    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
+    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
+    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come!
+  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
+    carpenter?
+  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
+  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
+  Clown. To't.
+  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.
+
+                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.
+
+  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will
+    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
+    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
+    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
+    liquor.
+                                            [Exit Second Clown.]  
+
+                       [Clown digs and] sings.
+
+       In youth when I did love, did love,
+         Methought it was very sweet;
+       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
+         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
+
+  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
+    grave-making?
+  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a Property of easiness.
+  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier
+    sense.
+  Clown. (sings)
+         But age with his stealing steps
+           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
+         And hath shipped me intil the land,
+           As if I had never been such.
+                                            [Throws up a skull.]
+  
+  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
+    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that
+    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a Politician,
+    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,
+    might it not?
+  Hor. It might, my lord.
+  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
+    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that
+    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it- might
+    it not?
+  Hor. Ay, my lord.
+  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd
+    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution,
+    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the
+    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
+    on't.
+  Clown. (Sings)
+         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
+           For and a shrouding sheet;
+         O, a Pit of clay for to be made  
+           For such a guest is meet.
+                                      Throws up [another skull].
+
+  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
+    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
+    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock
+    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
+    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a
+    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his
+    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of
+    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
+    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of
+    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
+    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will
+    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have no
+    more, ha?
+  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
+  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
+  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
+  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I  
+    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
+  Clown. Mine, sir.
+
+    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
+              For such a guest is meet.
+
+  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
+  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
+    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
+  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for
+    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
+  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
+  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
+  Clown. For no man, sir.
+  Ham. What woman then?
+  Clown. For none neither.
+  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
+  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
+  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
+    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three years
+    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe  
+    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls
+    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
+  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that our
+    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
+  Ham. How long is that since?
+  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the
+    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
+    into England.
+  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
+  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits there;
+    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
+  Ham. Why?
+  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as mad as
+    he.
+  Ham. How came he mad?
+  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
+  Ham. How strangely?
+  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
+  Ham. Upon what ground?
+  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy  
+    thirty years.
+  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
+  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have many
+    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in, I
+    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last
+    you nine year.
+  Ham. Why he more than another?
+  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a will
+    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of
+    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath lien
+    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
+  Ham. Whose was it?
+  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it was?
+  Ham. Nay, I know not.
+  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon of
+    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
+    skull, the King's jester.
+  Ham. This?
+  Clown. E'en that.
+  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,  
+    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He
+    hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes. And now how abhorred
+    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those
+    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes
+    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
+    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your
+    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
+    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
+    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio,
+    tell me one thing.
+  Hor. What's that, my lord?
+  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
+  Hor. E'en so.
+  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
+                                          [Puts down the skull.]
+  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
+  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
+    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
+    stopping a bunghole?
+  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.  
+  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
+    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
+    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
+    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto he
+    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
+    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
+    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
+    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
+    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
+    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-
+
+    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
+             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]
+
+    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
+    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
+    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
+    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
+    Couch we awhile, and mark.
+                                         [Retires with Horatio.]  
+  Laer. What ceremony else?
+  Ham. That is Laertes,
+    A very noble youth. Mark.
+  Laer. What ceremony else?
+  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
+    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
+    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
+    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
+    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
+    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
+    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
+    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
+    Of bell and burial.
+  Laer. Must there no more be done?
+  Priest. No more be done.
+    We should profane the service of the dead
+    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
+    As to peace-parted souls.
+  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
+    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  
+    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
+    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
+    When thou liest howling.
+  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
+  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
+                                             [Scatters flowers.]
+    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
+    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
+    And not have strew'd thy grave.
+  Laer. O, treble woe
+    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
+    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
+    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
+    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
+                                             Leaps in the grave.
+    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
+    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
+    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
+    Of blue Olympus.
+  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief  
+    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
+    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
+    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
+    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
+  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
+                                            [Grapples with him].
+  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
+    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
+    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
+    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
+    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
+  King. Pluck thein asunder.
+  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
+  All. Gentlemen!
+  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
+             [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
+                                                         grave.]
+  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
+    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
+  Queen. O my son, what theme?  
+  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
+    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
+    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
+  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
+  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
+  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
+    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
+    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
+    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
+    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
+    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
+    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
+    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
+    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
+    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
+    I'll rant as well as thou.
+  Queen. This is mere madness;
+    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
+    Anon, as patient as the female dove
+    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,  
+    His silence will sit drooping.
+  Ham. Hear you, sir!
+    What is the reason that you use me thus?
+    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
+    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
+    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
+Exit.
+  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
+                                                   Exit Horatio.
+    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech.
+    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
+    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
+    This grave shall have a living monument.
+    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
+    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
+                                                         Exeunt.
+

+
+
+Scene II.
+Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.
+
+Enter Hamlet and Horatio.
+
+  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
+    You do remember all the circumstance?
+  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
+  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
+    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
+    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
+    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
+    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
+    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
+    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
+    Rough-hew them how we will-
+  Hor. That is most certain.
+  Ham. Up from my cabin,
+    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
+    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
+    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
+    To mine own room again; making so bold  
+    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
+    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
+    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
+    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
+    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
+    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
+    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
+    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
+    My head should be struck off.
+  Hor. Is't possible?
+  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
+    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
+  Hor. I beseech you.
+  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
+    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
+    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
+    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
+    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
+    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
+    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now  
+    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
+    Th' effect of what I wrote?
+  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
+  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
+    As England was his faithful tributary,
+    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
+    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
+    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
+    And many such-like as's of great charge,
+    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
+    Without debatement further, more or less,
+    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
+    Not shriving time allow'd.
+  Hor. How was this seal'd?
+  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
+    I had my father's signet in my purse,
+    which was the model of that Danish seal;
+    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
+    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
+    The changeling never known. Now, the next day  
+    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
+    Thou know'st already.
+  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
+  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
+    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
+    Does by their own insinuation grow.
+    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
+    Between the pass and fell incensed points
+    Of mighty opposites.
+  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
+  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
+    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
+    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
+    Thrown out his angle for my Proper life,
+    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
+    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
+    To let this canker of our nature come
+    In further evil?
+  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
+    What is the issue of the business there.  
+  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
+    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
+    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
+    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
+    For by the image of my cause I see
+    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
+    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
+    Into a tow'ring passion.
+  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?
+
+                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.
+
+  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
+  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
+    waterfly?
+  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
+  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
+    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be
+    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess. 'Tis
+    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.  
+  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart
+    a thing to you from his Majesty.
+  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
+    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
+  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
+  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
+  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
+  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
+  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot
+    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that
+    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter-
+  Ham. I beseech you remember.
+                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
+  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is
+    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman,
+    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
+    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card
+    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of
+    what part a gentleman would see.
+  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I  
+    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of
+    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
+    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
+    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
+    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
+    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
+  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
+  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
+    rawer breath
+  Osr. Sir?
+  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in another
+    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
+  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman
+  Osr. Of Laertes?
+  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
+    spent.
+  Ham. Of him, sir.
+  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
+  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
+    much approve me. Well, sir?  
+  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
+  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
+    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
+  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him
+    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
+  Ham. What's his weapon?
+  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
+  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
+  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
+    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
+    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
+    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
+    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
+    very liberal conceit.
+  Ham. What call you the carriages?
+  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent
+    ere you had done.
+  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
+  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
+    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.  
+    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
+    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the French
+    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call it?
+  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
+    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
+    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
+    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
+  Ham. How if I answer no?
+  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
+  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
+    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
+    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose,
+    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
+    shame and the odd hits.
+  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
+  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
+  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
+  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
+    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
+  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.  
+  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
+    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes
+    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter-
+    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
+    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
+    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,
+
+                            Enter a Lord.
+
+  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who
+    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to
+    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will
+    take longer time.
+  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
+    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
+    I be so able as now.
+  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
+  Ham. In happy time.
+  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
+    Laertes before you fall to play.  
+  Ham. She well instructs me.
+                                                    [Exit Lord.]
+  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
+  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in
+    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
+    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
+  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
+  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
+    would perhaps trouble a woman.
+  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their
+    repair hither and say you are not fit.
+  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
+    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come', if it be
+    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
+    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he leaves,
+    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.
+
+    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
+              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
+               A table and flagons of wine on it.  
+
+  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
+                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
+  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
+    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
+    This presence knows,
+    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
+    With sore distraction. What I have done
+    That might your nature, honour, and exception
+    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
+    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
+    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
+    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
+    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
+    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
+    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
+    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
+    Sir, in this audience,
+    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
+    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts  
+    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
+    And hurt my brother.
+  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
+    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
+    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
+    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
+    Till by some elder masters of known honour
+    I have a voice and precedent of peace
+    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
+    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
+    And will not wrong it.
+  Ham. I embrace it freely,
+    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
+    Give us the foils. Come on.
+  Laer. Come, one for me.
+  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
+    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
+    Stick fiery off indeed.
+  Laer. You mock me, sir.
+  Ham. No, by this bad.  
+  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
+    You know the wager?
+  Ham. Very well, my lord.
+    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
+  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
+    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
+  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
+  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
+                                                Prepare to play.
+  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
+  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
+    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
+    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
+    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
+    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
+    And in the cup an union shall he throw
+    Richer than that which four successive kings
+    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
+    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
+    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,  
+    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
+    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
+    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
+  Ham. Come on, sir.
+  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
+  Ham. One.
+  Laer. No.
+  Ham. Judgment!
+  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
+  Laer. Well, again!
+  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
+    Here's to thy health.
+               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
+    Give him the cup.
+  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
+    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
+  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
+  King. Our son shall win.
+  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
+    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.  
+    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
+  Ham. Good madam!
+  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
+  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
+  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
+  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
+  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
+  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
+  King. I do not think't.
+  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
+  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
+    pray You Pass with your best violence;
+    I am afeard You make a wanton of me.
+  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
+  Osr. Nothing neither way.
+  Laer. Have at you now!
+                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
+                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
+  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
+  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.  
+  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
+  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
+  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
+  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
+    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
+  Ham. How does the Queen?
+  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
+  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
+    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
+  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
+    Treachery! Seek it out.
+                                                [Laertes falls.]
+  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
+    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
+    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
+    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
+    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
+    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
+    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
+    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.  
+  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
+    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
+  All. Treason! treason!
+  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
+  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
+    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
+    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
+  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
+    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
+    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
+    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
+    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
+  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
+    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
+    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
+    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
+    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
+    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
+    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
+    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright  
+    To the unsatisfied.
+  Hor. Never believe it.
+    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
+    Here's yet some liquor left.
+  Ham. As th'art a man,
+    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
+    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
+    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
+    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
+    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
+    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
+    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
+    What warlike noise is this?
+  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
+    To the ambassadors of England gives
+    This warlike volley.
+  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
+    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
+    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
+    But I do prophesy th' election lights  
+    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
+    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
+    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
+  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
+    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
+                                                 [March within.]
+    Why does the drum come hither?
+
+    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
+                  Colours, and Attendants.
+
+  Fort. Where is this sight?
+  Hor. What is it you will see?
+    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
+  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
+    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
+    That thou so many princes at a shot
+    So bloodily hast struck.
+  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
+    And our affairs from England come too late.  
+    The ears are senseless that should give us bearing
+    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
+    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
+    Where should We have our thanks?
+  Hor. Not from his mouth,
+    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
+    He never gave commandment for their death.
+    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
+    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
+    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
+    High on a stage be placed to the view;
+    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
+    How these things came about. So shall You hear
+    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
+    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
+    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
+    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
+    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
+    Truly deliver.
+  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,  
+    And call the noblest to the audience.
+    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
+    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
+    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
+  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
+    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
+    But let this same be presently perform'd,
+    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
+    On plots and errors happen.
+  Fort. Let four captains
+    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
+    For he was likely, had he been put on,
+    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
+    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
+    Speak loudly for him.
+    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
+    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
+    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
+            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
+                                                   are shot off.  
+
+
